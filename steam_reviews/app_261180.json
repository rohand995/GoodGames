Maybe even THE most intense. This game makes it so the ball goes really fast. And I mean FAST. The maximum speed a ball can get to is 10,000. That is ridiculous. The characters are all very enjoyable too. The aim is to get the most points or be the last one standing. When you hit someone with the ball, they go flying across the screen and off it. The characters play pretty much the same, but with different special moves. Raptor's baseball bat can send the ball going straight forward, Switch's kick flip can make the ball move weirdly and confuse players, Candyman can confuse the player by sending the ball across the screen and looping to the other side of it, Sonata's bass drop can give the ball extra speed, Latch can eat the ball and spit it out whenever he wants, and Dice's curve shot can send the ball flying in weird angles. If the ball gets enough speed, the stage can noticeably change. That's kind of a tough to notice detail, but it's cool.\n\nOverall it's a crazy dodgeball fighting game. The ball goes everywhere, crazy attacks can be performed, and people go flying off the screen. That's why my final rating for this game is a Super Smash Bros. out of 10.

That's the beauty of Lethal League though is it aims to keep the fun simple with a delightful mechanic and well animated and imaginative characters and music.  Here are my lists of Pros and Cons by Catagory \n\nGameplay- Pros:  This game is fast paced and has a mechanic revolving around a ball that kills upon impact from another player's succesful swing and hit.  the object of the game is to knock out the other fighters ala super smash bros or other arcade fighters by smashing the ball their way in hopes that they will not have the reaction time to swing back and be slammed out of the arena.  The gameplay is fast and addictive and best experienced with friends and is highly based on reaction time and the ability to angle the ball or juke other players with the \"bunt\" function or special hits that build up as you hit/bunt the ball.  In short it's a fun arcadey baseball deathmatch game with a simple but unique mechanic.\n\nGameplay-  Cons:  The single player \"challenge\" mode(this games version of super smash bros's classic mode) leaves much to be desired and is quite simple, and while the ai can be challennging for a new player at first it is never as difficult as a real player leaving multiplayer the best option.  There are multiple game modes but most players seldom use or even have fun with them, and the game could use more content on the single player and gameplay mode selection side overall.  \n\nGraphics- Pros:  The art style and characters are lovingly inspired from a variety of sources most notably I see hints of super smash bros characters and jetset radio style stlye.  You have a baseball loving tough kid, a woman that uses a boombox on a stick as a bat, a man with a piece of candy for a head, and a cyborg alligator, and a robot(who uses a skateboard as his bat and means to get around), and a man named Dice...who oddly enough uses a ping pong paddle.  The art is lovingly design and the stages and characters have a lot of personality\n\nGraphics- Cons:  The characters could use a few more animation touch ups and overall new animations I'd argue and the art style is sometimes used to cover up what is a seemingly simple engine, the stages could use some work too and I feel some of them while inspired could use even more touchups and design changes both aesthetically, and gameplay wise(they are all essentially boxes)\n\n\nMusic/Audio- Pros:  This is where the game really shines in the music department.  If you enjoyed Jetset Radio at all you will feel more then welcome and at home here then you have in a game since that series.  The music is incredibly well done and produced and I'll sometimes find myself wanting to play certain stages in the game just to hear the tunes.  \"Ordinary Days\" is a personal favorite of mine though all the tracks of each stage and menu are seething with excellent production and unique \"garage future\" tones.\n\nMusic Audio- Cons:  The characters are lacking in some voice overs and you'll often hear the same voice clips over and over again.  This is not all bad as some lines are quite clever but I really wish the dev team would give them a bit more life with some new and alternate lines.\n----\n   Overall the game is pretty fun if you have some buddies itching for some crazy arcadey multiplayer.  It can get pretty intense as the ball speed ramps up higher and higher until the stages are tearing at the seams.  I don't recommend purchasing it at full price however, I would wait for a price drop or a sale to pick this rad, lovable, indie arcade fighter in the future.\n\n\"Check this!\"", "timestamp_created": 1460319815, "timestamp_updated": 1460319815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "22329403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101095814", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1653187294}, "language": "english", "review": "Game looks fun and starts out fun, but then you realize how little content the game has.

I had already been playing a lot of it, and they had never played in their life. Now, when I thought playing alone was fun, I never accounted having friends to play with. But when more people joined the game, it becomes hilariously joyous, with a lot of tense moments of only two people left and the ball being at over 1000 speed, some people figuring out new attacks, or people getting that three-hit wipeout, mostly on accident.\n\nAll in all, Lethal League is a sweat-inducing and creative game, bringing a fresh idea to the fighting game genre, and one that works incredibly well. The multiplayer works great, hit detection is fine, the characters are interesting, and the gameplay is just plain awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1456609998, "timestamp_updated": 1456609998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "21455573", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997927004", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1937, "last_played": 1447068045}, "language": "english", "review": "Delievers what it promises in an exciting and fun way, though what it promises could be more.", "timestamp_created": 1456449060, "timestamp_updated": 1456449060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "21454726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084476428", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1454812985}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would do baseball on crack again", "timestamp_created": 1456445501, "timestamp_updated": 1456445501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "21445612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155733001", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 894, "last_played": 1715112091}, "language": "english", "review": "How it was made\n\n1.

Oh, right. I'm writing a review. Here's my pros and cons list if you don't want to read the rest of my review.\n[list]\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[*] Fast-paced high-intensity gameplay that only increases in speed and intensity as the match goes on\n[*] Beginner-friendly with an optional tutorial that can be replayed as many times as needed, as well as a practice mode\n[*] 6 characters to choose from with unlockable character colors the more you play\n[*] Online and local multiplayer supports up to 4 players\n[*] Free-for-all and Team Battle game modes\n[*] Single player campaign mode available (and achievements for beating it with each character)\n[*] Gameplay is fluent and customizable with either keyboard or controller, controlled with 3 buttons outside the four directional movement buttons\n[*] Amazing Soundtrack (at least, I think so)\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[*] Lethal League online translates to Lethal Lag; I'd recommend not playing online if you and your friends do not have a fast and reliable internet connection\n[*] Not much variety in terms of content; the single player campaign is just a series of battles against CPU opponents.\n[*] Depending on your musical tastes, you might not like the soundtrack. This can always be remedied by adjusting the in-game volume settings and playing your own music over the game.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] The long version of the review [/h1]\nIf I was to describe Lethal League in one sentence, it would be Baseball Combat. You play as one of 6 characters, each with a different ability, and you hit the ball back and forth until it hits someone. When you get hit by the ball, you lose a life; when you lose all your lives, you've lost the match. I should note that hitting other characters directly does absolutely nothing, so you have to focus on hitting the ball such that it collides with your opponent. \n\nUp to 4 players can play at once, and the game modes include a free-for-all deathmatch as well as a team battle mode which supports both 2vs2, 1vs2 and 1vs3 modes. Friendly fire is optional (referred in-game as ball tagging) to allow a more intense experience should you choose to play with it. \n\nThis game is very keyboard friendly if you don't have a controller (as I don't have a very good controller); controlled with the directional arrow keys for movement and the Z, X and Spacebar for other movements, you can re-map all the controls as you see fit in the options menu. My friend can confirm that this game plays great with a controller as well.\n\nWhere I think this game shines brightest is its multiplayer, especially when playing with friends. With friends, regardless of how much I was winning or losing, not a moment went by where we weren't having the time of our lives. This game is very easy to learn as the controls are limited to movement, jumping, hitting the ball and bunting the ball (hitting it lightly), and the optional replayable in-game tutorial explains things sufficiently. \n\nOverall, this game is best played with friends, but can be played just as well solo. Definitely recommended, especially if it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1454915261, "timestamp_updated": 1454915274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "21038793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002147764", "num_games_owned": 1561, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1479186637}, "language": "english", "review": "I can see why many people would enjoy this game; unfortunately, it lost my interest rather quickly.

In fact, I think I have decided that once every nine or ten days I think I am going to play a game of my own choosing, in order to balance out the reviews, and to keep me from going crazy.  So I figure the best way to start off my \u2018player\u2019s choice\u2019 series would be Lethal League, a multiplayer smash fest from Team Reptile.  Now, I admitted earlier that I really wasn\u2019t that big on fighting games, and in fact often just pounded the controller like I was asking for another beer at a crowded bar hoping the other guy walked into my punches.  I confess now that there was one unmentioned exception to that statement, and that was the classic Nintendo 64 version of smash brothers.  I actually spent a significant amount of time refining my skill in that game, partially because it was a fighting game I was actually fairly decent at, but more because it was oodles of fun, and a great game to play with friends.\n\nFast forward a decade and change, and we have Lethal League, which is a rehashing of the typical multiplayer chaos on the screen everyone pounding controllers while jumping up and down and \u2018accidentally\u2019 kicking each other while playing sort of game, only this time with the added fun of dodgeball rules added in.  See, instead of simply smashing each other directly, players instead knock a little color coded ball back and forth with the goal of hitting someone else, knocking them out until the next serve.  Difficulty is added as the ball\u2019s speed increases every time it is hit, giving players a reward for timing over button mashing.  Each character even has their own special move, from Dice\u2019s occasional arcing of the ball over everyone's\u2019 heads to candyman\u2019s wall-looping trick, each character has a way to frustrate everyone else playing.  And with both online and local multiplayer modes possible, this game will give you enough play value to make it worth any amount of money, and eventual frustration over whoever picks Latch.  Can\u2019t recommend this one enough, folks.  Have fun!\n\nGame\u2019s Fate: Kept.  Also installed on the laptop.  Never know when you want another round\nBuy/No Buy: Buy.

fantastic game and I cannot wait for the sequel, Lethal League Blaze.\n\nLethal League is a competitive, multiplayer game that is a spin on sports games and arguably fighting games. You and up to three others have to bounce a ball back and forth until one of you inevitably gets hit by it. It sounds simple but it's so deep and so fun that it's the kind that is easy to pick up and difficult to master. That's where the fighting game comparisons come from. It's basically if a fighting game's only mechanic was teching but instead of teching hits from each other, you tech the ball back and forth. There are different kinds of techniques and special moves to learn to throw off other players and being skillfull and unpredictable with the ball pays off greatly.\n\nThe music and art style is beautiful to indulge in. It invokes feelings from games like Jet Set Radio and Smash Bros with its characters embodying a similar culture to that in Jet Set Radio. Every stage has a unique look to it with also unique dynamic screens when the ball gets to a certain speed and every track is great to listen to.\n\nPlease support these developers and show them we want more stuff like this. The Lethal League sequel is just around the corner and I am so stoked.

All this makes it hard to avoid the ball and also hard to hit the ball. Each player has a certain amount of lives per round and lose them by getting hit with the ball.

LOL has gamers making significant contributions to the entire gaming industry.\nLethal League on the other hand pulls most of the heavy weight packaging from teenage angst with each match. They it lays basic mechanics and a joke of a metagame over it. It generally lags behind LOL by a mile or two in inventiveness. I never see this game at tournaments or mentioned by anyone over the age of 25.\nSo tell me again, how exactly does Lethal League innovate? It even struggles to release fresh plays with each match, and artwork is about the only original thing with Lethal League.\nYes, Lethal league is stable because it is standing on the shoulders of socially awkward teenagers. Most of the hard work is hashed out before they ever start playing \"games\". This is fine, and what games are all about, but I prefer to be in with the leaders rather than the followers.\nWhat really irks me and what has really brewed my hatred are Lethal League players. They seem to think Lethal League is responsible for all that is good in the vidya world. I have just proven how false this is.

When you hit a fast ball, there\u2019s a pause before the ball launches off again and your opponent can time it to hit the ball right as it \u201cunpauses.\u201d At the same time, you can flash a little shield that blocks their hit during the pause if you time it right. And finally, each character has their own special ability that messes with the movement of the ball and makes it less predicable, especially at higher speeds. With all of these little things in place, it makes a weird \u201cPong fighter\u201d into a chaotic and fun game to play with friends.\nThere\u2019s one thing to watch out for.

Lethal League is a ton of fun though. Once you got used to how the game works the ridiculous amount of things that can happen are endless. The game offers three different game modes; free for all, team, and strikers. Free for all is exactually what you would expect up to for people all trying to knock eachother out by hitting the ball. Team is the same way other than being able to work with your teammate to control the pace of the game. Stirikers is basically soccer where each team is trying to hit the ball into the other teams goal while also trying to protect your own. For free for all I would reccomend three people because with four people the game gets to hectic for me personally. Also the soundtrack in this game is sweet! Overall though I would highly recommend this game to anyone as long as you have friends to play with.

And the most important thing is... if you get hit by the ball and your opponent was the one to hit it last, you're out. No hp bar, just out. \nSoon you realize you get into some intense Sudden death action, when the ball is flying around on the screen at 50 speed and you're a one shot out. But if you hit the ball and it goes fast enough that the enemy dosen't have enough time to stop it,  they're out. You start to go crazy waiting for the inevitable out of yourself or the other player, nobody ever has a sure chance of winning.

Instead your hitting a ball at intense velocities slowly creeping up in momentum until one of the players hits it back faster or is knocked out by the ball. This is where it gets insane. Each character, despite its low roster, has special abilities to either make the ball move faster or cause insane mix-ups on the other players. They all have simular properties to SSB characters: like fast falling, Dash Dancing, and floaties. The big thing that you need to learn in this game is not really the technical prowess, but learning the frames of the game, predicting where the balls is going to go, and timing every hit correctly. \n\nAside from all this jibber jabber, this game offers minimal stuff to do aside from leveling up, unlocking skins, and comepleting a offline challange mode simular to a arcade mode of somesort.

Simple concept, but it can be hard to master and it's much more fun than you'd think. I only wish that they add more characters because there are only 6 right now.

It\u2019s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.\n\nDespite sharing a name with one of [strike] Modern Warfare\u2019s [/strike] Lethal League best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north and coming to blows with the U.S.\n\nThe prelude establishes a harrowing vision of a United States homeland that's broken but not beaten \u2013 not quite Red Dawn, but not Fallout 3, either. It\u2019s a space not often explored by modern shooters, and its mood is heightened by missions set in a besieged Santa Monica and the wasted remains of San Diego, to the tune of an excellent, somber score from David Buckley (The Town, Metal Gear Solid 4). But ultimately, time on the poignant homefront is short lived as the story goes behind enemy lines in Caracas, the Andes mountains, and other exotic locales.\n\nThose might lack to familiarity, but the variety of environments keeps the campaign fresh, not only in terms of visuals, but in gameplay as well. Instead of just fighting waves of enemies through a linear stage at ground level, you\u2019ll find yourself rappelling down skyscrapers, flying helicopters, having firefights in space, commanding tanks, scuba diving through shipwrecks, playing as a dog, and evading shark attacks. Each requires new strategy, acute situational awareness, and \u2013 in the case of the space and water missions \u2013 special consideration for verticality and physics.\n\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Call of Duty game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Ghosts delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation\u2019s space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.\n\nBut like previous CoDs, the story of Ghosts struggles to remain in focus amidst the fray of explosive cinematic moments and relentless firefights. Narrated loading sequences with stylized story animations push the campaign forward, but only last for one or two minutes before launching back into the action. It\u2019s there, on the front lines, that much of the plot progression is presented and oftentimes lost.\n\nIt's by no means an achievement in dramatic storytelling \u2014 it's more about dumb fun \u2014 and it lacks the player-choice element introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but when given time to breathe Ghosts actually offers some interesting human drama. The story centers around two brothers, Logan and Hesh, their father Elias, and yes, their dog Reilly as they fight the Federation as part of the battered remnants of the U.S. military, and later as the elite Ghosts squad. The family ties, specifically the relationship between Logan and Hesh, made me care about the protagonists in a series that's habitually made its characters a dispensable commodity. The voice acting is decent overall, though there are periodic moments of cringe-worthy dialog, like one superfluous moment when Elias reveals he\u2019s a member of the Ghosts. And then there\u2019s Riley. Though the subject of many a meme at this point, Riley not only acts as a useful tool for recon and silently dispatching enemies, but is integral to several dramatic sequences, saving your character on more than one occasion.\n\nThe story stumbles in the second act when it strays away from the more evocative character focus in favor of a long stretch of back-to-back missions driven almost exclusively by guns-blazing combat. While not poorly done, this visually arresting, action-packed, but ultimately hollow middle stands in stark contrast to the effective first and final acts. On the bright side, that padded out my play time to roughly 10 hours, making this campaign one of the longest CoD single-player experiences.\n\nThe Verdict\n[strike] Call of Duty: Ghosts [/strike] Lethal League isn't a reinvention of the franchise, but proves there's still room for innovation within its existing formula. Though at the risk of overcomplicating things at times, its robust multiplayer gameplay, surprisingly fun co-op modes, and lengthy, challenging, and varied campaign makes [strike] Ghosts [/strike] Lethal League one of the best Call of Duty games to date.", "timestamp_created": 1469588101, "timestamp_updated": 1469588101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475388556718826294", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "24494490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073296102", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2454, "last_played": 1555821681}, "language": "english", "review": "-batten down the hatch, here comes Latch.\n-batten down your bitch, here comes Switch.\n-batten down your rice, here comes Dice.\n-batten down the chapter, here comes Raptor.\n-batten down the enchilada, here comes Sonata.\n-batten down the garbage can, here comes the Candyman.\n", "timestamp_created": 1469346734, "timestamp_updated": 1469346734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470508664846420288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "24470897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086603734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2416, "last_played": 1453064925}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah I know Candyman is your favorite character shut up.", "timestamp_created": 1469238911, "timestamp_updated": 1469238911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494925916194915771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "24397040", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993040629", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1411913249}, "language": "english", "review": "Meme game.\n\nIt was okay.", "timestamp_created": 1468876568, "timestamp_updated": 1468876568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.39264148473739624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "24386043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040679848", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 583, "last_played": 1540091901}, "language": "english", "review": "HAVE A JAWBREAKER", "timestamp_created": 1468829804, "timestamp_updated": 1468829804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "24384392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154378832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 642, "last_played": 1488066525}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is honestly just pure fun a great party game all ten hours on this game were enjoyable tense matches even with the simplistic gameplay amazing and tight", "timestamp_created": 1468818984, "timestamp_updated": 1468818984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "24381879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149557931", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1557029323}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first opened this game I immediately sank to my knees and wept tears of pure joy, and by \"pure joy\" I mean \"pure Jack Daniel's\".

Jolly ol' Lethal League.\nWhat can I say about this game, considering I just got it yesterday? A lot. I guess.\n\nTHE STORY:\nThere is no story. :/\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY:\nImagine Super Smash Bros. with no platforms floating in the sky. Then, add dodgeball into the mix. Yeah. Dodgeball. Who doesn't like that maniacal, murderous hellfest of a game? It's better than it sounds though, which means there won't be any dodgeballs flying at your literal face. Realism.\nThe controls are pretty simple. You use the left and right arrow keys to move... fairly simple. Z to attack... sure. X to stop the ball from zip-zapping all over the place... cool. Spacebar to jump... aweso--\nWait a sec... the Spacebar to jump? That's a bit unexpected for a Steam game, don't you think?\nWhen you hit the ball, you can use the up and down keys to set the angle you're going to hit the ball with.\nYou have 8 lives by default (you can change it in settings) and it's your job to knock out your opponents one by one. When the ball is your colour, it can't hurt you at all. Or can it? I have no idea.\nIn terms of colours, P1 has red, P2 has blue, P3 has yellow and P4 has green. Cool.\nLike Smash Bros, there are different skins (or \"flavours\") for each character. None of the skins, heck, none of the characters play any different. So really, you can just choose any character without any problems.\nUnless...\nThe special attacks!\nEach character has their own special attack. Candyman has Candyball (in which the ball can teleport through walls and look like an awesome face while it's at it), Latch has...\nUm...\n...\nServes me right for only playing as Candyman.\nWhat can I say? I love him and his jawbreakers. No matter how weird they taste. (innuendo not intended)\nYou can hit the ball 4 times until you can use your special attack. Just press Z two times. It doesn't always work though.\n\nTHE GAMEMODES:\nOnline, versus, challenge and training. That's it.\nBut, there are sub-gamemodes in the versus mode. There's free-for-all (self-explanatory), team (again, self explanatory) and strikers (each team has to hit the ball in the goals they're trying to attack. In other words... soccer.\n\nTHE VISUALS:\nThe visuals are kinda like the 2003 Ninja Turtles cartoon. Cartoonish, but pretty edgy as well. The graphics look a bit pixel-y, but they do the job well.\n\nTHE MUSIC:\nNot the best soundtrack. The tracks are pretty cool, but I'd be screwed if I remember what they sound like.\nThey're better than my music though. I'll tell you that.\n\nPROGRESSION:\nEach time you play the game, you earn EXP. You all know what that is. Progressing to more levels gives you new \"flavours\" to try out. I especially like the black Candyman. He tastes like licorice.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nThe game is pretty fun and memorable, and it's one of the most innovative Steam games I've seen (and this game was made in the 2010's, when Call of Duty was still around). Sadly, there is no local multiplayer, but I'll forgive it, considering that it's not frickin' Fireboy and Watergirl.\nMy final word on this game is that this game is...

Players jockey to control a small ball, hitting it around the screen in an attempt to knock out eachother.  Every hit on the ball speeds it up, and it quickly moves from an easy to predict slow moving projectile to a streak that bounces around the screen, ricocheting off ceiling, walls, and floor to take out players.  \n\nThis simple set up leads to an exciting and incredibly fun game.  Unlike most fighting games, there are no long lists of special moves to learn and memorize (each character has slightly differnt angles they will hit the ball at, and a special move that can be powered up during play and used, but no difficult button combos are required for any moves).  This makes the game very intuitive and easy for players to jump in and start playing, even if you are not into fighters.  However, the interplay between player and their specials does lead to a suprising amount of depth in the combat, and learning the timing to intercept balls as they come off of other players at higher speeds will take practice.  \n\nIf I had any criticisms for the game, it would be that the simplicity of it can be a double edged sword.  Games can start feeling repetative during long play sessions.  Game options can extend this a bit, but in the end most feel gimicky and I find myself losing interest after 30-60 minutes.  However, that being said, I still find myself coming back to this game to get in a few quick rounds against friends when we don't have time for a long playsession, or to finish out a night of gaming.  And that is where the game shines imho, quick bursts of action and excitement when I don't have the time to spend hours playing.\n\nThis games perfectly fills a niche in my gaming library.  It is well worth the price (and worth getting a few extra copies for your friends as well).

You can try to search for matches online, but most of the time it's just unfruitful, and the online mode has quite a few connectivity issues, especially if the match has more than two players.

Cover it in an art style similar to Jet Set Radio. Add quirky characters and you're all set. Lethal League is one of those games that's difficult to describe.

If you hit the ball, it turns your color. When you hit an opponent with the ball, they die. Last one standing wins. Last won standing after ten lives is declared the winner of the match.  To win, the game requires you to have cat like quickness. Each hit that the ball takes from a player it speeds up. The more players hit it, the faster it will go. Matches are usually five minutes at the most, so this game is great to kill a few spare minutes if you have a busy schedule. I would highly recommend this game to those who want to try a unique take on some well-known game mechanics.

Heck, buy the four-pack and get some friends in on the action.

If you get a couple of friends and all play together, this game is one of the best times you'll collectively have.  I haven't played in the open multiplayer so I can't vouch for the online community, but playing against friends is simply fantastic.  The online multiplayer will occasionally desyncronize when starting a match, but it only takes about 10 seconds to exit the game, restart it, host a new lobby, invite your friends into it, and restart.  The desync error also is not particularly common, certainly less than 10% of matches will have this issue.  Not a serious detraction from the overall game.\n\nThere are, however, two things missing: a replay system and a spectator mode.  There are many situations where it would be nice to have a replay so you can answer questions like \"How did that shot hit me?\" or \"That was an awesome move, can I see that again?\"  I hope the devs will eventually include some form of replay management.  The inclusion of a spectator mode would make this game viable for some tournaments and casting.

Lethal League is a somewhat simplistic fighting game of the same nature as DiveKick, where you have to own the ball to own the court. Don't let this fool you, however: Each of the 6 characters has their own unique jumping style, angle of attack, and powerful special move to unleash at just the right moment. For instance, Latch can grab the ball in his mouth and fire it back out at another angle; Raptor slams it twice in quick succession; Candyman (who just wants to watch the world burn) lets loose a menacing jawbreaker that goes through walls, the ceiling, and even the floor to wrap around the other side of the pitch.

There are 6 characters to choose from, each with slightly different mechanics and playstyle. Whenever you hit the ball, it gains speed and turns your color, becoming able to kill your opponents if they can't deflect it and becoming unable to kill you. You and 1-3 other players keep building speed trying to eliminate eachother as the chaos element grows exponentially. Rounds are short as you try to get as many points as you can. As you play, you unlock a couple additional play modes and character pallet swaps.\n\nReally good game. My only real complaints are that the story mode is balls hard in the later levels, and that online play with randos online can become fairly laggy. Really, the main draw of this game is playing with friends on a game night, either locally or by hosting a private server. The game will give you probably 5-15 hours of solid play with friends, although I'd prefer the more fleshed out sequel. This game on sale is a nice low-investment starting point though, if you want to buy a 4-pack for you and your friends/game group before deciding on the superior, more pricey sequel.\n\nAlso the style of the game is really awesome, graphically, story-wise, characters, and music. It reminds me a little bit of those late 90's/early 00's Sega games (Crazy Taxi, Power Stone, and especially Jet Set Radio).

The audio, the graphics,  the gameplay, list goes on and on and on. However, despite the sheer awesomeness of this game there are a few problems which i will address : \n\n-playerbase/multiplayer wait time\nThe amount of time untill i find one player is beyond insane. Prior to buying lethal league i looked at the amount of players present and to my suprise i saw 600-700 people, i thought well, since this is primarily aimed towards multiplayer, the amount of players should fine. A few minutes later i reassured myself and bought it. After the totorial of lethal league i did not waste any time, i decided to play my first lethal league multiplayer match.........It took ages, but then a guy named Squaresx5 saved me from my misery, i pounced in joy breaking my chair in the process. I was so happy, even though i was a noob and knowing that i will slaughtered. \n\n-Replay value\nI know the time i accumulated is trivial which results in my review being little to no significance, but from first sight, the HUD, the menu and so on i seem to be getting the same message all around the place.

Lethal League technically doesn't have a lot of content. I'm about 8 hours in and I've already maxed level and beaten the arcade mode once. But we have an old saying in the male community. \"It's not the size, it's how you use it\". This game is horrendously fun in multiplayer. The controls are tight and the netcode is top notch quality. The game relies on two things to make multiplayer fun: Satisfaction value and reaction time. Luckily, it nails both of them. First of all, I'll actually explain the game. It works in a small square room (One of five maps) and a ball spawns in the middle. Every time a player hits the ball, it becomes his color and it cannot hurt him, only his enemies. While hitting the ball he can also do two things: Aiming the ball up or down and activating his special ability. The special abilities add some depth due to learning how each should be used to the best effect. For example, one characters special allows the ball to travel through walls for a little while. At first I only tried to fake people out with it on the ground, and catch them unawares. But over time I learned that if I applied an aim to it I could cause it to go flying through the ground and the cieling at an angle, which is incredibly hard to perdict and dodge accordingly. Alright, on to the aforementioned satisfaction value. As the ball gets to higher and higher velocites, each smacking of the ball results in the player smacking the ball for not only about 5-6 seconds straight, but also the screen freaking out to high hell. So basically, every time you hit the ball, it feels like you just punched through the earth. Additionally, the music is some of the best I've ever heard in a video game. The tracks are nice and varied, with each track seemingly blending in with the endless sounds of the ball getting smacked into the fifth dimension. The one aspect which can devide people is the art style. It's a simplistic art style, no doubt, but some will find it attractive and some will find it boring. It's really just a matter of opinion. All in all, it's a blast with friends and the soundtrack is amazing, but if you just want to find a good solo experience, I don't know why you're looking at an arena fighting game.", "timestamp_created": 1409495848, "timestamp_updated": 1409495848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "11935035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009740253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1586, "last_played": 1448650566}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the best multiplayer games I've played in a long time!

In this game you fight your opponents by hitting a ball at them and that's it, on the surface. It's basically an easy to learn and hard to master game.\nEach character of the 5 you (at least currently) have to choose from has their own abilities, for one they all have different jumps of varying height and I think their movement speed varies too but it might be the visuals tricking me. On top of that they all have different special attacks, one makes the ball warp through the arena wall and come out on the other side, one double swings at the ball to increase the speed by ridiculous amounts and so on. Making use of those skills correctly is what will set you apart from the rest in the end.\n\nThe game has a singleplayer component but I don't see why you'd wanna play against AI opponents in a game like this.\n\nThe netcode for the multiplayer seems quite good, but it you want a lag free game I still recommend just going 1 vs 1. From what I gathered it's not perfected for more players yet but it's still posible to play a 4 player free for all with no issues, but know that there might be disconnects or desyncs happening in those.\n\nThe visuals aren't amazing but for this kind of game they work quite well. Not all games has to be super flashy 3D and stuff, if the game works better with a simple 2D look then that's the better choise in my opinion.\n\nThe music for the game is great.

In the early days there was Windjammers. A discthrowing 1v1 pong-like game in a form of a fightinggame with different specialmoves and characters.\nThis game on the other hand takes those Ideas and give them a new look and feel and resembles one of the most unique games of this decade.\n\n\n#### What are we doing exactly? #####\nThe goal of the game is getting a ball to hit your opponents. You can hit the ball in many directions and the ball is bouncing of the walls. There are different attacks and specials you can do to speed up the ball or causing it to change directions.\n\n####### Gameplay ######\nSmooth as butter. Easy to learn, hard to master. You can get relatively far with just playing with feel and a little bit random button presses. But if you learn how to combo, parry and reducing your hitlag, you can get constant wins.\n\n####### Graphics #######\nThe graphics are completely 2D. It looks like it was done by MS Paint, but it has its own funky style. The graphics are snappy and look good. Especially the effects when you hit the ball as it reaches the speeds of  max 1000000pixel/s (I think thats the speedindex)\n\n####### Balance ########\nThe game seems to be well balanced. Every character is different and has a specialattack and peculiarities like walljump, doublejump, wallclinging and driving across the ceiling with a skateboard. Also the angles, in which the ball flies after a hit, are different aswell. Because it is more about how you handle the ball, i don't think there will be overpowered characters.\n\n####### Network ########\nThe netcode is powered by ggpo. You can feel how good the netcode is.. even with 4 players it's smooth as hell. There are some hickups, witch result in disconnects, but considering the age of the game, I wouldn't be surprised if the game got some updates to fix this. After all it's just a little annoyance, which is forgotten after you desperately try to reconnect to the massive fun. (which is fast anyway)\n\n###### Conclusion ######\nThe game is a must-have. The fun we had in just 6 hours was tremendous.

While there's order in the chaos, nothing is more fun to get the ball speed up to insane heights and hope you survive. \n\nThe game rules and controls are simple and to the point; hit the ball, bunt the ball and jump to avoid the ball, while trying to hit other characters with it. Each of the 5 characters has their own specific special abilities.\n\nThere might be a learning curve when it comes to timing your shots and being able to track the ball the faster it goes, but with practice comes alot of fun, and when you master it, it gets EVEN BETTER. It's recommended to play with friends, locally or online, but randoms can be fun too if you find the right guy.\n\nGGPO, this game's online component, is a little more tighter than done with Street FIghter 3: Online edition, altho sometimes you notice people dying yet not, but the game is so fast you don't care anyway and adjust accordingly.\n\nIf there's one slight I would give this game: Not too often, It can and will crash at a certain point, persumably one of the characters specials will hit the ball and might crash one of the players out of the game. It's a sad thing too, because other times it won't happen and gameplay flows fine. I'm expecting this to be fixed in an upcoming patch of some sort.\n\nAll in all, an excellent fun and simple game that gets deeper the more you get into it, and a great way for a bunch of buds to spend some time smacking each other in the face with high velocity balls.\n\nYeah.\n\n8.7/10", "timestamp_created": 1409316790, "timestamp_updated": 1409318106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "11906608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045052578", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 350, "last_played": 1513555880}, "language": "english", "review": "it's alright", "timestamp_created": 1409305816, "timestamp_updated": 1409305816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "11905692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017322963", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1550359958}, "language": "english", "review": "A good quasi-fighting game with a surprising depth.

To make immediate comparisons, it's like Smash Bros meets Pong meets Divekick, with a lot of emphasis on the Divekick part. The goal of the game is incredibly simple: hit the ball to gain control of it, try to smack it into everybody else. If someone else hits the ball, don't get hit and try to return the ball.\n\nThis game is deceptively simple, and I say this because even though the mechanics are limited, the ways in which you use those mechanics are actually fairly deep. You have two main actions you can take, you can hit the ball or you can bunt the ball. When you hit the ball, you can either send it flying straight, or angle it up or down. Bunting the ball will slow it down to its lowest possible speed and pop it in the air, giving you time to place your next hit strategically. Every hit will cause the ball to gain more speed, making it harder to keep track of, dodge, and hit.\n\nBut it turns out that there's WAY MORE STUFF YOU CAN DO THAN THAT. There are six ways of hitting the ball: on the ground, you can angle it up, down, or straight forward, in the air you can angle it up, forward, or spike it to the ground. Spiking the ball automatically doubles the speed, so you can cause the ball to get faster multiplicatively by spiking it over and over again. You can also bunt the ball up, forward, backward, or straight down, giving you options on where you place the ball. Hitting a ball at the same time as your opponent causes you guys to clash and bounce off each other. And with the five characters, each one has their own super move, swing speeds, swing arcs, and hitting angles. This game hits every fighting game requirement in respect to its depth, but at the same time it has that appeal that Divekick has of being super easy to pick up.\n\nThe music is amazing in this game, all the tracks are taken from independent music creators, and it sets the entire tone of the game really well. Tracks are intense and fun, matching the frantic gameplay. The sound design isn't shabby either, as the ball increases in speed you hear sonic booms, the hit sounds are really nice and snappy, this game loves to bombard you with its really solid sound design.\n\nThe art style is really great, too. Well drawn backgrounds that aren't too busy, but are still dynamic and change as the ball moves faster and faster. The characters are really interesting looking and are animated well, and your moves feel like they have weight behind them.\n\nAs for the online, it works beautifully. Lag is completely unnoticable, when it works it works well. I did have occasional disconnection problems, but it was pretty negligable as me and my friends could jump back into the game really easily if anything went wrong and pick up with a fresh round.\n\nThe only possible complaint you can levy against this game really is that the content is slightly lacking. With only five characters to choose from and six stages, it might leave you wishing for a little more to play with. But all in all, this game is an incredibly solid mechanical marvel that is great fun with friends.

The focus on a single projectile livens up an old genre with pong-like battle mechanics.\n\nLethal League is also quite easy to pick up. The controls are simple, though there are a number of little tricks to learn, as well as ball trajectories. It will make a great party game, and it's a lot of fun for 2-4 players (the more the merrier IMO, though a good 1 on 1 can be intense).\n\nThe solo 'challenge' mode is sufficiently challenging, and if that's not enough, you can also hone your skills against hard bots in versus play. As a solo player, you'll likely spend most of your time in online matches. My experience with online play has been good so far, often feeling as good as the local game.\n\nThe art style is a matter of personal preference. I love it. I also love the way visual effects are tied in with the game's core mechanics, with distortion animations playing when the ball breaks certain speeds.\n\nThe game's starting roster is small - just 5 characters - but they play quite differently. Some of the differences are obvious, like special attacks, jumps and special movement (like clinging to walls or skateboarding on the ceiling), while other differences are more subtle (like the angles of upwards and downwards strokes). There are rumours of more in the works, and it has been said that new characters will be added to the game in free updates.\n\nWith all this in mind, Lethal League is a wonderful gem of a game, perfect for people who want something to play with friends, locally and online, and also great for competitive fighting game players looking for new ways to test their skills and reflexes without memorizing long combos.", "timestamp_created": 1409181526, "timestamp_updated": 1409181526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "11890769", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967818923", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1621799380}, "language": "english", "review": " Buy this game right now.

Overall, pretty good game! \n\n8.7/10 Armin Points\n\n                                                                                                                                  -ProcrastinatorArmin", "timestamp_created": 1412480140, "timestamp_updated": 1412480270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262473106384277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "12359206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123342737", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 972, "last_played": 1461456963}, "language": "english", "review": "original funny distenct characters, Awesome stages, best music soundtrack ive ever heard in a game, cool unlockable flavors, and most of all its addictive.

I saw videos of people playing it on youtube and loved what i saw. got in and realized... the game is hard, still fun, but hard. the ball goes up to high speeds quicklyso an average game is around 3-4 minutes at 8 lives starting at the default speed. there are a surpriding amount of strategies you can come up with after you figure out the nuances of the characters. my personal favorite is the fact that if you aim up with Switch (the robot skateboarder) the ball goes up and behind you, the hammer girl (Sonata) can change the ball direction with her special, my girlfriend even enjoys playing the aligator (Latch) because she can play \"Walligator\" by clinging to a wall and swinging until she can grab the ball and shoot it at me point blank. \nall in all it's a good game\nsolid sound track\na \"challenge\" mode that reminds me of super smash bros classic 1P mode.\nart style isnt much at first but it grows on you\nminor connection issues in online multiplayer\nlocal multiplayer as well as online\neasy to learn hard to master i would say (a lot of little details that make you better, but arent needed for casual play)\n-basics\n  - swing (hit ball, ups speed by 1) [aimable]\n  - bunt (knock ball up next to hit it gets bonus special meter) [aimable]\n        - once bunted the ball will move at a low speed but resume previous speed when hit by a player or hitting the ground\n  - parry (hit bunt during a hit to drain your special and knock back nearby players) [must be trying to hit the ball]\n  - slam (downward air swing that doubles the speed of the ball)\nspecials and traits\n-candyman\n  - ball will teleport to the wall opposite the next wall it collides with keeping speed and direction, refreshed if CM hits it again\n  - candyman has no heavy falling\n  - candyman has the sharpest slam angle\n - sonata\n  - special hits the ball 3 times after release, can reaim the ball at these points\n  - has a double jump\n - latch\n   - can climb walls\n   - largest hitbox\n   - special eats the ball, carries it, and releases at speed it was caught\n - switch\n   - can scate on walls and cieling (limited time)\n   - upward aim goes behind him\n   - special is activated as a doublejump, if the ball hits switch during his kickflip the ball is hit by switch (counter)\n -

from GGPO.  4 player games tend to lag/desync a bit, but as long as you are not playing across countries, it handles it well.  1v1 online is nearly perfect from my viewpoint.\nController support is also good, I have tested 4 different controllers, all of which worked.  Only a few required minimal key binding.\nGameplay itself is of the \"simple to pick up, hard to master\" variety.  Great for local party/competitive play.  Its fast paced, and has a lot of \"epic moments\" for all your friends to hype about.\nNot much content to be honest, though the game is obviously about multiplayer, and they do have a few modifiers to change things up.  But this is an important note, if you don't have good internet/local friends, do not get this game.  Though I doubt anyone reading this falls under this category.\n\nI personally like the art style, I have heard a lot of people complain about graphics.  I don't really need to review this though, if it looks ugly in the screenshots, you will find it ugly in game.\nBoss soundtrack, as in GOOD electronic music, not try hard dubstep.\n\nIf my review seems badly written, it is because I am not a writer.  But you can trust me on this, Lethal League is amazing for what it is, and is definitly worth the asking price.  Anyone who is shying away because it is \"too simple\", there is a lot of depth/mind games to be had in hitting a ball back and forth(as silly as that sounds).  Is it another Nidhogg?  No.  Another Divekick?  ehhh, maybe, depends on whether you hated Divekick for its gameplay or for other reasons.  To me, this seems like a similar concept to Divekick, though better polished, different gameplay mechanic that is more hype because of its faster/more deep nature, and a better presentation.  This game is definitly better than Divekick, but still holds the similar concept of simple but hard to master.\n\nIn the end, yes, I do recommend this game.  This game will entertain you and your friends for a long time.\n\nIf I have not answered your questions/concerns about this game, leave a comment and I will edit the review.\n\n\"I am terrible at this game.\n\n10/10  Would noob rage again.\"\n\nEdit: Nominated for The \u201cI Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\u201d Award.", "timestamp_created": 1409359010, "timestamp_updated": 1480000535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.84128570556640625", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "27168549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118621683", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1736997339}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a very good game, i have a lot of fun, the problem is that there is not enough ppl playing online", "timestamp_created": 1479995234, "timestamp_updated": 1479995234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "27165160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028884251", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 918, "last_played": 1571673397}, "language": "english", "review": "A uniquely themed 2d fighter with all the awesomeness of one but none of the complicated mechanics.

It is a bit challenging to learn though and gets repetitive fairly quickly, which makes it a bit harder to recommend.\n\nThis chaotic multiplayer game puts several characters in a small arena where you smack a ball around while trying not to get hit by said ball, all while the ball gains speed rapidly until it becomes an impossible blur that destroys all in it's path. It's quite chaotic and a lot of fun. Each of the 6 characters also plays slightly differently and has it's own special move, which adds to the chaos, although it does make it a bit harder to learn the game. There are a few different versions of this game to play (free-for-all, teams, and a team variant where you try to hit the other team's goal instead of their players). Unfortunately, this is all there is to this game, and it starts to get repetitive fairly quickly. There is also a single-player challenge mode, but it's very hard and very grindy, so you're unlikely to get much more out of it. It does seem like there is a high skill ceiling, where you could learn the game very well and matches would become much more interesting, but it seems very difficult to reach this, as the game doesn't teach you much about the intricacies of different techniques and mechanics, and the few existing guides that I was able to find were insanely technical and very hard to read. So while this game did give me and my friends some fun, we do tend to go a long time between sessions in this game.\n\nThe graphics look decent and the music is quite good. The game also runs well, other than one annoying online multiplayer bug where lobbies would suddenly become impossible to use. Apparently this is a known issue though that simply requires everyone to restart their games, so it wasn't much more than a minor annoyance.\n\nNote that [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/553310/Lethal_League_Blaze/]Lethal League Blaze[/url] was released a few years ago as the sequel to this game. I haven't played it, but some reviews seem to indicate it is better. It's worth looking at before buying this game at least.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] This is a decent, chaotic multiplayer game with a fun premise, interesting mechanics, nice graphics, good music, and no bugs outside of one annoying multiplayer issue. However, the game is a bit hard to learn, gets fairly repetitive fairly quickly, and the sequel to this game was released a few years ago, which some reviews indicate is better, so while I'd still recommend this game, I'd probably only get it if you can get it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1645322374, "timestamp_updated": 1645322374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "110531254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109764429", "num_games_owned": 588, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 3466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3445, "last_played": 1731477538}, "language": "english", "review": "better than blaze", "timestamp_created": 1645237742, "timestamp_updated": 1645237742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "110241185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024974970", "num_games_owned": 1897, "num_reviews": 567, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1563053587}, "language": "english", "review": "Dodgeball mit Baseballschl\u00e4gern.", "timestamp_created": 1644862234, "timestamp_updated": 1644862234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "110213788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307303435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1589133985}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game for both single-player and multiplayer.

He's pretty cool tho, but all of the characters are fairly equal, the gameplay is based more on player skill, combos and the way you use your character's gimmicks and powers, not just those alone.

Honestly thats my only complaint its just so dumbfounding I cant help but say Im dissapointed\n________________________________________________________________________________\n-Full Rant-\n       I really didnt expect to have to give this game a bad review. It has fun gameplay, nice characters, and overall I found it fun to play alone. But I didnt buy this game to play alone. I wanted to play this game with my friends and family, and since they dont each have a computer of their own I usually stick to buying local multiplayer games. Games like stick fight, move or die, broforce. All indie games. But never before have I had so much trouble playing a multiplayer game in my life than before this game, Not because the game ran terribly or because of some glitches. It was because this game refuses to recognize other controllers and you must manually set up each input for each controller. We didnt know this when we got the game and we wasted 30 minutes checking my computer, my controllers, and my adapters only to realize its the games fault. Never have I seen this before and it makes no sense. If other indie games that likely worked with a similar budget can make seperate inputs immedietly and you only have to connect them to play why couldnt this game.  Ive done my reasearch, and followed any steps I could find and none work. This one detail almost ruins the entire game for me. I shouldnt have to go through all this trouble to play one tiny transition or party game.

fix this, I suggest that over the course of a round, as ball volleys and speed increases, you\u2019ll eventually reach a threshold where the AI will allow you to hit them with the ball. \n  This encourages players to use their skills to survive until they reach that point  \n", "timestamp_created": 1515465681, "timestamp_updated": 1515465681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

The object of the game is to hit a small ball back and forth, changing its colour to the player that touched it last, if a player who is not the same colour touches the ball (as in not hit it) they die and lose a life, zero lifes left and the player is eliminated. Now heres the kicker, as the ball gets hit more and more, it gains more and more speed, extreme amounts of speed one could say and the colours of the game starts changing to match the intensity and the speed that the ball is going at.

Every match is a quick game of reflexes and quick thinking as well as honest strategy against both your opponent(s) and the ball all while still trying to simply predict and track the ball all together. The result is just a fun chaotic match that's quick and easily finished but also intense and engrosing.\n\nI also love the urban style given to the levels and especially the characters. Each character looks unique and cool as well having a nice anime Inspired look that, while risky, paid off and is a perfect example of taking inspiration and not simply copying it.\n The Controls could be slightly quicker but it's a small complaint. I only wish for more characters in the future or maybe simply a sequel. As well I'd also like to see a lot more levels to choose from as they are more just backgrounds.

Sound crazy? It is a little bit. Allow me to elaborate: The point of Lethal League is to hit the opposing player(s) with the ball without getting hit yourself. The ball starts off slowly, then gains speed through continuous hits and bouncing off of the walls like in Pong or Arkanoid. You can alter the trajectory of your hits by holding the corresponding direction on the joystick when you hit the ball. You can greatly accelerate the ball's speed by jumping in the air and performing a \"slam\" which rockets the ball back down to the ground. Each of the 6 playable characters in the game have special traits and abilities that can alter the ball's velocity, timing or trajectory to fake out opposing players. The game can be played 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2 or free for all style, similar to Smash Bros.\n\nThis game also reminds me somewhat of Divekick. The game is very accessible, fun and easy to pick up and play, but I'm a little skeptical about it's long term playerbase retention. I confess I haven't played too much of this game, but I'm suspicious that Lethal League may not have the mechanical depth to keep players coming back for more. Even if it may be somewhat lacking in staying power, Lethal League is still a fun and fast-paced game to pick up and compete with friends or strangers online.\n\nAlso of note is the game's awesome soundtrack which falls musically somewhere between Hotline Miami and Jet Set Radio. Like Hotline Miami, the soundtrack is a compilation from several artists that still manages to have a unified sound. Of note is \"Scream\" by Bignic, \"Ordinary Days\" by Klaus Veen and \"Urabon\" by Grillo. I know I've said this before, but I love when game soundtracks have a unique sound like this. Not enough games do that.\n\nLethal League is a fun, fast-paced and accessible spin on the fighting game genre. I'm a little skeptical about this game's lasting depth, but you should play it yourself to decide where this falls on the scale between novelty and legitimate deep competition. At least I hope you'll be able to agree it has an awesome soundtrack\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/", "timestamp_created": 1439858798, "timestamp_updated": 1444506441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "18408189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038727436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1557424411}, "language": "english", "review": "Game doesn't start on mac", "timestamp_created": 1444468501, "timestamp_updated": 1444468501, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477732568979263306", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "18363296", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971117241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1444184506}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this would be a very fun game worth $14.99 if the online play worked.

It's a projectile fighter, so your aim is to hit the opponent with a projectile (in this case, a ball). Simple, right? Well, you have different ways to hit the ball, directions you can aim it, and specials specific to your character that make each matchup intense. Games can be over in a second once the ball starts moving fast, or even in the first ten seconds if you play right or predict your opponents' moves. There's immense satisfaction in each return, and the game really excites you with the euphoria of good returns mixed with the  rush and fear if your opponent somehow still returns the ball that you just shot at him at 10000 mph. It's sort of similar to in the projectile match between Link and Ganon in the Legend of Zelda, except you die if you screw up once. There's a few game modes that you can switch between, and there are some options to tweak your matches. The options are a little limited, but honestly, the game is so fun that you won't really even need to switch things around to have a great time. Definitely check this out sometime!\n\nWith online play: I have had some problems with online battles with friends (game freezing up after stage select, player randomly disconnecting after game), but none of these problems were fixed in under a minute and didn't occur that often.

It reminds me of Smash in a way even though its completely different, in that you are constantly timing and lining up juggling, since that's what the entire game revolves around; juggling the ball to gain speed and take your opponents out. \n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1420141122, "timestamp_updated": 1420141122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "13765004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001183206", "num_games_owned": 1375, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1623546895}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely awesome action-packed wild killer-baseball game of dodgeball.\nSoundtrack is tasteful and cool electro stuff.

It runs very smoothly, minus a few hiccups here and there (95% of the timee only happening during a 4-player match).\n\nEach of the characters and stages feel balanced, that is no one seems overly powerful. Every character has a special ability they can use after filling their gauge as well has having unique properties, (Sonata has a double-jump, Latch can cling to walls and strike from wall-cling, ect).  Each character has their own playstyle and most will find one they like over others.\n\nThe only real flaw I've seen so far is that the single player/challenge mode is a little boring, but oh well.  Online is more fun anyways. \n\nOverall I would strongly recommend this game.

You get the picture.\n\nThere are only 5 characters, and they seem to all be the same at first, but they all have different angles when hitting the ball and they can interact with the environment in different ways.

You and up to 3 other characters swat a ball around a room, picking up speed each time. You can't be hit with the ball if you hit it last so the game quickly turns into finding the angle of the balls path so you can hit it back to the other plays. Considering the speed of the game can rapidly crank up to supersonic the game gets very very hectic very very fast. Controls are simple enough to get the hang of 10 seconds, arrows to move, space to jump, z to swing and x to bunt, but they have enough nuance to warrant a mention. When you swing and hit the ball you can influence its direction by holding up or down to effect its angle. Bunting and then hitting the ball techincally counts as 2 hits, thus it fills your special bar by half. Each character has a special move, unique to them, that can be activated by double tapping the swing key when you hit the ball.  The netcode, the same one from Skullgirls, if I've done my research, is absolutely awesome. Disconnects are rare and there's pretty much no lag. The art style is decent, with each character sporting a completely different build and frame, to easily distinguish them. Each stage is nicely simple, has a unqiue soundtrack, and changes backround once the ball reaches certain speeds. Consider Lethal Leauge HIGHLY recommended.

Being completely free of over complication, Team Reptile have fortunately channelled the most special elements of the nostalgic games of the golden era, where a sole focus on gameplay has driven design and development. The result being a game with no apparent story, not character progression, and no cheap ways of making you feel as though you should be playing the game, instead it slaps you in the face with a fresh take on Fighters, that is plain and simply, unsullied fun.\n\nThe gameplay and structure of LL lends itself perfectly to the resolution of longstanding disagreements (1-on-1 Fights), bouts of personal worth and glory (4 way FFA), and also to bond-building exercises (2-on-2 Team Fights). The beautiful thing about the simple gameplay is it works so well not only in the hectic 4-way FFA, but also in 1-on-1 combat, where the simple mechanics eventually boil down to a game of whits, where you are more trying to force the other player/s to swing at the wrong point, or you are trying to think and act fast enough to catch them off-guard.\n\nThat long winded jargon can be distilled down to; this game is perfect for playing with friends, and that is exactly how it should be consumed. This game has one of those qualities where if you get served too hard, you will hate it; so take it in with friends and you will instantly see the gratifying outcome of learning together, while also pulling off some badass manoeuvres resulting in you all squealing like manly Girl Scouts. We have not tried it in Online Play as my internet services would make the game run like an interactive slideshow. But we can safely say that by grabbing a few ales, a few controllers, and huddling around your PC, you will be parting in the finest display of competition I have seen in a video games since Mario Party 64.\n\nTeam Reptile have not given this game a huge amount of content, with 5 characters and 6 Levels, BUT, the content in the game is so perfectly polished, I question whether the development team is really as small as they say. We would love to see more playable characters and levels in the future just to give the game that bit of spice, but where it stands now is a testament to where AAA game development falls short in modern game development; where such heavy focus on being the next money making machine makes games lose that\u2026specialness.\n\nFrom a developer\u2019s standpoint this game has soul, you can feel the love that went into it when you play it. So get it, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\n3 / 3 Worth Playing\n\n-C\n", "timestamp_created": 1409530115, "timestamp_updated": 1409530115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609917104244232178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "11940947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004531228", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 756, "last_played": 1429851860}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 Instant addiction to slamming 1000 mph cyberballs into fools faces.", "timestamp_created": 1409526693, "timestamp_updated": 1409526693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "11940564", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988727628", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 535, "last_played": 1416454750}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely brilliant.

I've bought this game a while ago and at the time it did feel like a really fun game but there's just way more to that. Not too long ago I started playing Lethal League again and this time I actually tried myself to practice and play better. Certainly this was and is the most fun I've had in Lethal League in a while. I now adore it because it feels so exciting playing trying your best and once getting a hang of it you immersed on how intense you can make a match from 0 ball speed to beyond what you can normally handle. I do feel disappointed myself that I have not played this game enough but I'm glad to come back to this game. Unfortunately I've hit some drawbacks/flaws and it's getting to me.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n - Very simple gameplay and controls, hard to master\n - 7 different levels, with some differences that do impact gameplay nicely\n - 6 playable characters (including 1 secret character) with different abilities, personalities, and even skins to unlock\n - Different game modes to play on each level + customizable game options\n - Challenge mode, as well as Training and How to Play for any newcomers\n - Learning the game play helps you understand your opposition and your kind of play-style so in the end of winning any game mode it feels super rewarding\n - Fantastic graphics and wonderful art style (one of my favorites)\n - Controller support\n - Up to play with 4 players local or online mode\n - One of the best game soundtracks I've heard to this day, absolutely flawless\n\nIn fact, this game has some sort of blessing because in my opinion you can play any House, Techno, Hip-Hop, any sort of Electric style music and it fits right in perfectly. It blows me away because I never have much games that I could play my own music too and that would also fit into playing the game. \n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n - The worst part that gets to me about this game is that after playing it for a while you realize that it lacks content. You start to realize that's there's really not much. It's a huge con because it makes the game feel somewhat barebones.\n - Controller users have the disadvantage of movement as sometimes the moving is not exact\n - Bots on higher difficulties tend to play more unfair as their AI gets too smart for you\n - You just don't get enough XP playing versus against bots. It's just not fair, they put all the big XP rewards to online games and what's worse about it is that this game released 5 years ago so the game alone you can't really find that many players now. You have to search for players outside of the game like in Discord servers and ask them to play with you\n - Dice is rarely spawned on random when playing versus against bots\n\nTo end off this review I could say that I wish this game didn't have any drawbacks. It's just too bad no one (of my friends) really play this anymore. Maybe it's time for me to move on now to Lethal League Blaze. Team Reptile however has done a phenomenal job on this game. I adore this game to bits and one huge reason is that it makes me reminisce the great times I've had playing brawl games with my brother and friends. I won't give up on this game because this game has got amazing replayability, and I recommend anyone to play this game. Wonderful game.

When the sequel comes out, I suspect people will move to it, leaving this game even dead-er.\n\nIf neither of these things bother you (perhaps you're more interested in going to local tournaments or playing with friends like I often do), I absolutely reccomend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1511403446, "timestamp_updated": 1511403446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "32543323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272003996", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4658, "last_played": 1656287125}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]The game itself is very fun, but performance is a serious issue.[/h1]\n\nLethal League consists of hitting a ball back and forth in order to (hopefully) hit and kill your opponent. Now, it gets much more complex than just this, with parries, clashes, bunts, smashes, and even specials being thrown into the mix, but the basic premise is always the same; hit the ball. You can play with up to 4 people, online or on local, and that's where this game really shines. It's extremely fun to play with friends, due to the easy-to-learn nature of the game, and how hectic and intense the matches can be. If you have a few friends that are willing to play, you're going to have a great time. Even with only a single friend, this game can be a blast. Most people complain about the online multiplayer, as it can be pretty difficult to find a match, with wait times of 5+ minutes just to find one. Don't let this discourage you, however, because the weekends usually boost the playerbase and if you find a match with someone, they'll usually play with you 20 games in a row, so you don't have to go looking for another player again. Sometimes you'll get matched up with a really laggy player, but this is as simple as quitting out and looking for another match. It does happen, but when it does, it's not that big of a deal.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very enjoyable, and I can see myself playing this for hundreds of hours. Contrary to what it looks like at first, every single character is unique and different. Even something as simple as the angles they hit the ball at or their hitbox size is different. Every single one of them is properly balanced, with none of them being \"the best.\" The only thing that determines their worth is the person playing them. Any character can beat any character. One of the main turnoffs is the lack of characters, with there only being 6 total to play as (excluding doombox.) But unlike most games, I see this as a good thing. This is due to the fact that all the characters have completely different feels to them, and with only 6 to choose, it allows players to actually learn their moves and develop strategies for each. More than 10 characters would be terrible for this game, because then it would be impossible to memorize all of their moves. And, unlike most other fighting games, there really aren't any \"combos\" that can be abused over and over again. Any ball can be hit if you're smart enough to know where to stand, or you know how to counter it. There are a few advanced concepts, as I mentioned above, but once you learn those, it's just getting to learn the ball and develop better strategies. If you ever want to switch things up, they do have a few things you can change, including a points mode, different types of balls, and even the ability to turn off ball tagging (making it so you can kill yourself with your own ball,) but generally the default mode is fun enough to not need anything added to it, and it's the most commonly accepted mode online. One of my favorite things about this game is how fast you can get playing, instead of waiting. Within 30 seconds, you can start a match, and within 4 minutes you can be done with one. If you are strapped for time, this will have you covered. Conclusion; you will not get bored of this game if you care enough to learn how to play. \n\nThe soundtrack is awesome. It sounds great and perfectly fits the exciting, fast paced action that usually occurs. It isn't just background music either; most of the tracks are pretty active, and can help build up the excitement. Unfortunately, there is only a very small selection of songs, with there only being one for each stage and then a few extras. \n\nThe perfomance is the downfall of this game. Everything about this game is perfectly fine, but the performance is absolutely god-awful. It actually isn't a demanding game at all; all of the art is somewhat pixellated, and barely anything warrants lag in any way. If you're worried about your older machine not being able to handle it, don't. It will work. The issue lies in the online aspect of the game. The game experiences no perfomance drops when doing local games or bots, but everything else has severe issues. For one, the game can randomly lag in the middle of games that have pretty decent ping. This is unacceptable in a game that has such a focus on timing and precision. There is also a severe issue with games of more than 2 players. When you look online for match, it automatically pairs you up with one other person, so all online matches you play (that I've come across, at least) are 1v1's. Any lag in a 1v1 is usually the result of the other person, not the game. However, this is not the same with a 3 player or 4 player match. Since Lethal League uses P2P connections, any players that lag the game slow down everybody else. This means that one person can slow down the entire game. There is also a crippling bug as of 6/18/17 that still hasn't been fixed for almost 9 months. When playing 3 or 4 player matches, the game can disconnect and prevent the match from starting. After this happens, every single person that has disconnected has to reload the entire game all over again. If you don't, the disconnection will continue to happen until you reload. This happens roughly once every third match for my friends and I, and it completely ruins the game. Just to play around 10 matches you have to reload 3 times. I really don't know why this hasn't been patched yet.\n\nAll in all, this game is pretty awesome. It requires a lot of skill, and it really stresses the importance of timing and precision. However, the frequent lag, crashes, and overall issues this game has can ruin the experience. If you have friends that are willing to buy it, or if you frequently play games on a local machine, I would definitely recommend it. A word of advice, though; wait for a sale. $14 is a lot for a game that only really consists of a small amount of content.

And it's an absolute blast. It's such a unique idea, and it's executed brilliantly. Up to 4 players, with 6 characters to choose from, are plopped in one of many stages with varying height and width (which matters for reasons I'll get to in a moment). There is a small ball, and you hit the ball to tag it as yours - making you invulnerable to it while it's still tagged by you, and deadly to any others it hits. That's the core of the game.\n\nNow there are various ways to hit the ball. A neutral hit (any hit made while not moving sideways in the air) can hit the ball up, forward, or down. It can also be charged, and if you hit the ball fully charged, it reduces the hit lag, more on that in a moment, and also doubles the speed of the ball. You can also SMASH the ball - which happens if you are moving sideways in the air while you swing. This hits the ball downwards and doubles the speed of the ball. Lastly, you can bunt the ball upwards or downwards, completely fixing the speed of the ball to a slow pace until it's either hit, or hits a wall. Hitting a bunted ball adds 2 bars to the Special Meter, which is filled at 4 bars. Bunting removes most of the hitlag off of any swing, no matter what speed.\n\nAs the ball gets faster, the hitlag increases. The Hitlag is basically the amount of time freeze there is when you hit the ball.Hitlag is generally bad - as when the hitlag is high, you're stuck hitting a ball while the opponent can set up a counter swing, if they can predict the angle. This makes SMASHing dangerous, as it only goes in one direction. As such, Bunting and Charge Swings are essential to give your opponent no time to react to the ball. \n\nOne more thing. While in hitlag, you can use your entire special meter to produce a small shield around the ball for a split second. If the enemy hits this shield, they are stunned and sent in the direction your ball will go - it's almost always a confirmed kill. This is helpful if you can predict an enemy is going to try to hit the ball as soon as it leaves your swing. It's also possible to use it on a ball you're both about to hit at the same time - if you hit it first and parry at the same time, they will probably hit the shield and die.\n\nCharacters:\n\nThere are 6 characters, all of which have unique characteristics and one unique special ability. Special Abilities can be activated by swinging while in hitlag. Some are better than others, but I don't think any are bad. For example, Raptors special hits the ball a second time, removes most hitlag, and allows you to change to any of six directions for the ball, even in a Smash. Candymans special sends the ball through a portal in the nearest wall, coming out the opposite side of the stage. \n\nEvery character also just plays slightly differently. Each character sends the ball at different angles for every type of swing, and have different movement speeds and mobility abilities. Latch can climb up walls and stick onto them, Sonata has a double jump, and Candyman just has a very very high jump. This can possibly give you an edge depending on the stage. \n\nMy Actual Critical Opinion\n\nLethal League is well made. It's mechanics work exactly as they intended, and it all fits together very well, creating a very well balanced game that is consistently fun. However, that fun is somewhat ruined if you're trying to play online, sometimes. The game's playerbase is very small now. It will take long queue times to find matches, 5 minutes if you're very lucky. I've waited 15 minutes many times. If you get in a game, it's likely with someone with high ping, or if not that, someone who is very dedicated to this game and infinitely better than you. Still, I think it's worth playing online if you can contend with the more medium-level players.\n\nIf you have friends who are also interested in this game, I recommend you get it. It's a very fun party game, or off game to play a few rounds in.\n\nIf I have ANY criticism for the mechanics, it's the parry system. Namingly, it's a little too powerful. There's very little inscentive to approach someone if they are ready to parry at a moments notice - thus it's almost always a better option to just predict the angle and hope for the best. This is being fixed in the sequel game, Lethal League Blaze - in which there is a counter to the parry, but that game is not out yet. So for now, you have to deal with parry's kinda ruining the fun sometimes. But that is a minor gripe.\n\nConclusion:\n\nLethal League is a great game. Amazing, in fact. You should play it. I wouldn't personally buy it at full price, but if it goes on sale, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. The game got me to love it enough to confirm I will buy the sequel, whenever that comes out.

This game deserves better... hopefully the sequel will be more widely populated. Almost super smash bros, almost pong, this game is an incredibly unique approach to couch competitive games. The basic controls and simple design makes it easy for anyone to pick up a controller and understand what is going on. That being said, most of the time, you and your friends have NO IDEA what is going on unless you have played for countless hours. That confusion  creates the kind of lighthearted antics you would get from a game like smash. Even though it is easy to understand, that does not mean it is shallow in depth. There are rather advanced things you can do with angles, and hit lag, specials, and parries. This game can get rather intense.\n\nLethal League is one of my absolute favorite games, despite my low game time, mainly due to having nobody to play against besides AI.

So you have your standard bot mode where you just battle it out with bots, the bots can be pretty derpy at times especially the lower leveled ones, but they are useful for training. Last thing you want to do Is dive straight into multiplayer. Then you have the challenge mode where you go up against progressively harder bots in a variety of contexts, this is pretty good for learning specific character's playstyles and eases you into harder and harder opponents, which I think is a nice touch, there is also a training function which gives you space to knock the ball around and just practice getting a feel for a character.\n\nOnto the multiplayer. Overall there is a pretty cool community out there, but also skilled. Skill is key in this game which is why I warn you not to dive headfirst into multiplayer unless you are familiar with the gamestyle. I suggest you find a character you like and learn that character; each character has there own abilities and angles, so learning those is key. After you've learnt a formidable amount about a character, move onto another if you feel up for it, it will force you to adapt but your skills will sharpen and you'll be able to understand what you're up against.\n\nBut yeah, brilliant game, I'd rate it a solid 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1431363120, "timestamp_updated": 1431363120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "15776142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071121751", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1557523947}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome:) Slap their faces with balls a great sports game.
