And the visuals are too intense, even on the lowest setting, it makes it too hard to see what's going on. I love the steam workshop adition to it, some of the player created ships look awesome, but because they require your shadow operative rank to be high to use, I don't get to enjoy them. Why not level up my rank? IT'S TOO FUCKING HARD TO DO THAT.

To me it's just a visualizer software that reacts to the music with merely particle effects. I would have wanted the enemy patterns be spawned in sync with the beat to make the game feel more reactive to your music (Tried different genres: metal, house, techno, ambient). Right now it just feels that the music and gameplay are in completely different layers and that doesn't work for me.\n\nOne could argue that there is some spawns reacting to the music but it doesn't feel that way. Often times you get bored and frustated when you start thinking all the things the game could have been. The spawns are too vague and unresponsive. I feel the main intent in design was to analyze the song length, create some sort of an enemy buildup into that timeframe and then spawn enemies with an intensifying interval towards the end. It's not a really elaborate system but a really generalized one.  It doesn't feel reactive to the music or feel particularly interesting.\n\nHere are a few examples that I wanted to see: \n*Having the enemy sprites pulse to the beat at times and giving you extra stuff if destroyed in a swollen state.\n*Having different enemy types pulse to different beats in the music.\n*Having certain archtypes of beat sequences built to the system. For example in house music the rythm, buildup and lead are quite predictable, those could be used as standardized information and made into gameplay events.\n*Every hi-hat spawning a small single enemy from a corner starting from top left and ending in bottom right.\n*Every bass hit it could spawn a round pattern of small popcorn enemies etc. \n\nMaybe if the core gameplay were more engaging, I would not have cared about enemy beat sync, meaning the lack thereof, that much. Right now I don't feel like it really holds it's own though. It feels there are many enemy archtypes that could be used to make the gameplay more engaging and less predictable.\n\nAlso the enemy sprites look clumbsy and lack animation which gives me a somewhat unfinished feeling while playing.

Have your music on your PC, use it as a weapon on a space shooter, and BLOW EVERYTHING UP! PROCEED! I give it a 8.5/10.

So to those who have epilepcy, turn away from this game immediatly for your health and avoid having a seizer.\n\nThe good: Use any music to play the game rather from your PC, internet radio, or even seach a track to find and play on from the in game menu. Each track you play has their own veriety of enemies, mini-bosses, and bosses. So each track you play will have different enemies. The game also has a lot of power ups, weapons, ships, and upgrades you can earn on this game by ranking up with high scores. The game also has local and online co-op. So have a friend you can play and listen to the music you both enjoy. There's some additional challenges from the ships you play to unlock more ships, and/or to rank up your secondary rank. Additionally, there is also the Steam Workshop added to this game. So there is a lot of custom ships and ship skins you can play around with.\n\nThe bad: It will feel very repeatative if you don't have a lot of tracks to play on. It might start to get easier the more upgrades you get, making the harder difficulties feel like a cake walk if you're good at these type of games. Sometimes the flashing effects can be annoying when dodging the red bombs you can't blow up with normal fire.\n\n....All I can say is, buy this game. Especially if this game is on sale. Get it immediatly. If you enjoy listening to music and playing a game at the same time like any other game you play, here you go. And if you got friends who play this game and want them to listen to the music you're playing on this game, then this is for you and everyone. Although I recommend taking a few breaks from playing this game. The flashing lights and strobe effects can be fun to look at. But after a few repeated playthroughs, I started to feel phiscally sick to my stomach and needed a break after playing it too much. Above all, it's fun to kill time and listen to music.\n\nX3", "timestamp_created": 1410645915, "timestamp_updated": 1410651464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "12087597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060168119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1519787567}, "language": "english", "review": "With solid mechanics, good gameplay, and a novel gimick, Beat Hazard is one of the best top-down bullet-hell shooters of 2010.", "timestamp_created": 1410632170, "timestamp_updated": 1410632170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "2754833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012130176", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8906, "last_played": 1590093039}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite simple but a lot of fun!", "timestamp_created": 1368665631, "timestamp_updated": 1410512728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "12067936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041665554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1584595680}, "language": "english", "review": "In short: This game is astroids on LSD, and I love it.  As with any good review, lets start with the postives.  First, this game looks quite pretty, especialy on a nice screen the colors are vivid and suit the game nicely.  Second, Its fun, truthfuly this is the most important part of a game.  It has a nice face paced gameplay (least with the songs that I have put through it).  It gets quite chalenging once you unlock the higher teir skill ranks, im not usaly a fan of skill unlocks, but I got the highest in like half an hour so i guess its fine.  Its crazy fun to have your screen filled with colors, not knowing which are things to avoid or is simply your laser of death, you might not like that but i find that it adds to the excitment.\nok, its cons time!  The game is a pretty slopy Xbox port, they didnt even remove the button promps, but this game feels more like its supposed to be played with a controler, especialy with the keyboard scheem and split screen (Yes, split screen!).  This is the worst part of the game: you have to buy a DLC, sure ill buy a good DLC like Tinny tinas assult on dragon keep, or a good Bioshock DLC, but I dont want to pay money to unlock a game mode (boss rush and online multiplayer) the DLC also unlocks various diffrent types of ships and the steam workshop.

And while it was growing, it never lost its easy-to-learn usability.\n\nEveryone interested in music should give this a try - it doesnt matter if you're going casual in this or seek a challenge for there are lots of leaderboards to improve on.

I bought the game because it had an interesting premise, and I loved the game because it really succeeds in turning that premise into a great time. Beat Hazard has almost a Guitar Hero/Rock Band feel without the gimmicky side effect; it is a game that will have you playing for hours just because \"oh, (song name) had a great beat for this! I want to try (song name)!\" And this is as your spouse/friends/family is sitting beside you, watching you play while asking incessantly, \"Can I try? Can I try?\"\n\nThe playability is literally endless. Literally. Music will always exist and new music will continue to be made, and you can play this game to the beat of said music via the form of mp3s (among others) and streaming. Be prepared to download songs you never wanted to admit liking just to try them out in the game. Be surprised as you find that certain songs offer you more challenge than you thought they would. \n\nWhen Beat Hazard claims the gameplay flows with the music, they're not just saying that. The beat picks up, the enemies fly faster, the colors get brighter, the bullets shoot faster. This offers a new level of strategy unheard of in other games, because if you know the song you are playing well, you'll know when it picks up and slows down and you can play accordingly. \n\nA few last positives before I end the review. The game tracks your high scores for each song that you have (for downloads, at least, I haven't tried with streaming). The game is easy to learn and great fun even for those (like me) who don't tend to like twin stick shooters. Great to launch at parties/get togethers/game nights. Great game to jump in/out of if you only have a few minutes to spare gaming. Multiple modes and unlockables. \"Just one more\" type of gameplay. Can be humorous at times to watch the enemy ships react to the music. It's actually kind of cute to watch them all quickly file onto the screen in a song that picks up quickly after a slow start, as if they all were sleeping off the screen until the blaring beat shook them to consciousness.\n\nOverall, great game.

However, the ultimate 'thumbs down', however tentative (consider this a 6/10), is because the game pisses me off so goddamn much.\n\nMainly it's the Shadow Missions; they're just way too unforgiving. As in, 'you will probably wake up covered in someone's blood' levels of unforgiving. Say, for example, a Shadow Mission saying \"Beat 3 Songs on Insane Difficulty.\" Fine.\n\nSongs only count if they're 3:30+ long. Fine.\n\nIf you die ONCE during this song (considering you have like 5 lives from the outset so if you're any good you should seldom fail a mission) it won't count towards your mission progress.\n\nThis is where you're gonna get angry. REALLY angry. You could get to the last 10 seconds of a song and die to a missile you couldn't see due to the game's patented Seizure-o-vision, and the game will flip you the bird and your time will have been wasted. If it was an instant game over when you died, it would be a bit more bearable, but as it is? You're gonna swear, you're gonna break stuff, you're gonna fantasize about meeting the people who designed these missions and kicking them repeatedly in the crotch.\n\nBack to the topic of the flashing lights, I started getting a headache within SECONDS of hitting the goddamned MAIN MENU. The photosensitive seizure warning at the start doesn't do justice to just how much eyestrain you're gonna experience. On top of that, the obnoxious flashing lights make it near impossible to see the, say, red glowing seeker mines or the tiny missiles that'll kill you and give a solid 'F U' to your current Shadow Mission.\n\nI'm perfectly fine with games being difficult, so long as they're FAIR. Super Meat Boy is fair. Dark Souls is fair. In both of those games, when you die, it's YOUR FAULT.

Effectively, Beat Hazard is a ombination of all of those things.\n\nBecause the gameplay is generated by your music your mileage may vary by a lot.  This isn't like Audiorsurf, where each song is playable if boring: certain songs are not playable at all.  The reason behind this is that sometimes nothing can happen in the song you're playing, or worse, monsters might spawn just before you hit a slow point.  The biggest issue with this game is that the music not only dictates monster spawns but also has a direct influence on your basic attack: You will not be able to kill things during quieter parts of the song.  This is absolutely game breaking at times.\n\nStill, if you know that you can avoid the problem, and honestly I really like the gameplay.  Beat Hazard has changed a lot over the years, to the point that I don't really recognize it from when I first played it.  There's an overall level up system and some perks, but they're not so important to the gameplay (at least that's my opinion).\n\nUnlike audiosurf this is hardly a chillout game.  This isn't something that I'll boot up when I just want to listen to music and maybe have something to do in the background: the gameplay gets pretty intense at times.  It's not necessarily difficult, but it does remind me of how harrowing geometry wars can get.\n\nI like this game but I don't play it very often, and gameplay isn't so different between songs that it feels unique.  For the most part each song plays out pretty similarly, which is good and bad.\n\nAt the end of the day I think you should have this in your library.\n\nOh, but the fucking ad that pops up as you're closing the game?

I don't think I would buy it if I had to pay over 5\u20ac, but let's get into it.\n\nThe download took about two minutes, and I could enjoy the game right away. I picked up my Xbox 360 controller and sat down after I had a quick coffee. \n\nI was met with the most flashing and colourful startup screen ever, and even the menus were pretty intence. This game is not for people with epilepsy, so don't even try it if you think you have it. Now the menus and settings was pretty easy to navigate, as you would expect from an arcade shooter.\n\n[b][u]The music[/u][/b]\n\nThe game came with a lot of music, but it clarely wasn't my taste, so you probably have to download some yourself. It can be hard if you don't have much technical knowledge though, as you have to browse your folders and find your music manually.\n\nAnyways, I bought the Mega Bundle, so I could play m4a files from my iTunes folders. But you can actually just convert your iTunes music to the mp3 format to play them, so the DLC s pretty useless. I did miss a Soundcloud implementation though, it was pretty good in Audiosurf 2.\n\n[b][u]The game[/u][/b]\n\nSo I selected 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, and gave it a go. The start was very similar to the good old Atari game, Astroids. Big astroids came flying by and became smaller pieces upon destruction, as you would expect. But after some time, the game became something pretty different.\n\nLots of spaceships attacked my ship and performed the old art of kamikaze. Most ships doesn't shoot projectiles, but they try to destroy my ship in many different ways.

But seriously, this game is awesome!  It has full iTunes support (with the proper DLC), it runs at a silky smooth 60 FPS, and the replayabilty is off the charts if you have thousands of songs on your PC (or Mac!) like me.  If your music playlist is big enough, you will literally NEVER run out of levels in this game!  If only they made this portable so we could blast the heck our music on our iOS devices anywhere we go...OH, WAIT.  There is!  There's also an iOS version of this game that you can take anywhere and play the tracks on your iPod Touch or similar iOS device.  Granted, that version is a BIT scaled down, but it retains the fun and replayabilty of the PC/Mac version, more or less.  But the compatability is not even the best part...\n\nThis game has full controller support and works beautifully with an Xbox 360 controller.  In fact, this game is a twin-stick shooter, through and through.  So you SHOULD play it with a gamepad. x3  And the graphics, while a bit limited in terms of 2D sprites, are very vibrant and colorful thanks to all the pryotechnics and lights that actually sync up to your music!  Is it too bright?  Turn the intensity down!  Do you want more color and lights?  Then, turn the intensity up more!  \n\nAnd not only do you get vivid graphics, great controls, and limitless replayabilty, but you also get a good handful of ships to unlock and play as.  And all of them play differently, each with their own varying styles of play.  In addition to the already substansial selection of playiable ships in the vanilla version, you can upgrade to the Ultra version and get more ships, more gameplay variety, more everything!  Not to mention that there is also the Shadow Ops DLC which adds even MORE ships and a new layer of gameplay!  But wait...did I mention this game has full Steam Workshop support as well?

It comes as no surprise that I really love Beat Hazard.\n\nTwo things to take note of. Music-based games are always more fun if you are actually an avid lover and listener of music. The same is true for Beat Hazard. I love music and thus I love the ability to start up the game and try out a song that I really enjoy. This kind of individual customization within games like this gives it a high replay value.\n\nSecondly, Beat Hazard is bright. And I don't mean smart. It's seriously bright and colourful, to the point where my eyes sometimes feel like that are taking some strain. It does look amazing, though. Me being a bit strange, I absolutely love it. It's like an audio-visual explosion, and it's phenomenal.\n\nSo what about the gameplay? I find it solid, fun and challenging, which really is what you want out of this type of game. It often starts off slow and easy, only to suddenly explode into a frenzy of dodging and explosions. The game keeps you entertained and you get to listen to great music (your own!).\n\nLastly, I want to point out that this game is good regardless of the music. Shooting on the rhythm of the beat and sound and having something great to listen to makes the game awesome, but what is great is that the game manages to play well and succeed at being fun even without that element. Essentially, it doesn't rely on the music for the game to be good. It is good, regardless. Some people may argue that games like AudioSurf rely too much on the music (although, I still absolutely love AudioSurf), and it is worth mentioning that it is not true for this game.\n\nEven so, the music does make the game just that much more enjoyable. Along with fantastic, over-the-top visuals, fun gameplay and great replay value this game succeeds in what it sets out to do.\n\n8/10 (if you are a music-lover).", "timestamp_created": 1385505603, "timestamp_updated": 1425661777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "3360492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021432900", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2370, "last_played": 1382968059}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazingly good rhythm space shooter!

It's actually pretty easy when you get the hang of it (compared to other shooters I mean) but that isn't a bad thing. It's more of a casual game despite its intense visuals, and sometimes that's exactly what you need.\n\nThe only major downside IMO is that you can't turn off the effects. I like explosions and stuff but some of the effects are unnecessary, such as debris having strobe lights too, making it somewhat confusing especially at higher difficulties when you blast a lot of things at a time. If only pieces of an asteroid or broken ship didn't blink, the effects would've been perfectly fine with me.\n\nNotes:\n- The more complicated your song, the harder it gets really. So if you have songs that shift around between low and high intensity sections (progressive rock/metal, trance, many orchestral pieces, etc.), it tends to get harder because the power if your guns and the enemies slow down but continuously spawn, which allows them to build up. After that low intensity part if it suddenly gets a high intensity part, you'll likely be facing a lot of explosions.\n\n- It doesn't like non-English song/file/folder names, but it'll read the file properly. It just displays as gibberish (ASCII) in-game.

Death Waltz has new meaning!\n-Any song that goes quiet for the bridge is DEADLY\n-The money system is not quite intuitive.... I end up with less money than I collect over the level (this is probably me being dumb though)\n-Not so much a con but it would be nice to be able to link youtube videos or music websites the same way we can do internet radio\n\nFinal thoughts:\nThis game is awesome!

F*** this game. I love it.[/quote]\n\n[i]CynicalPopcorn's HIGHLY Recommended! | 9.75/10[/i]\n[i]Good value for money? [b]YES![/b][/i]\n\n[i][b]WARNING:[/b]The game has a LOT of bright, flashing lights and as such people with photosensitivity issues should take this into consideration.[/i]\n\n[h1]Beat Hazard Summary[/h1]\nA twin stick shooter not only powered by music, but powered by YOUR music! Beat Hazard takes your songs and puts you into a world of intense, twin-stick shooter action. The music you play really impacts the flow of the game from the enemies that spawn to how fast and frantic movement on the screen is, especially when taking into account the wonderful, very bright visuals.\n\nThe game alone, \"regular\" Beat Hazard is awesome, however for the TRUE feel of the game purchasing the entire set of DLC is worth every penny. The \"Ultra\" DLC adds more ranks, new enemy, higher difficulty and improves the game all round. Then, to add to this chaos, the \"Shadow Operations Unit\" DLC adds a VERY nice element of challenge that adds a new ranking system along side the normal one which rewards the player for completing challenges. This, however, is not easy as a death during a challenge will set you back. Be it that the current song does not count towards a total of songs completed on 'x' difficulty, or that you lose ALL (yes, all) progress in that challenge, deaths are even more unbearable than usual.\n\nPlease note: In order to use songs from iTunes you will need to purchase the \"iTunes & m4a file support\" DLC. It's cheap, and I understand why they've done it. You're best off buying the mega bundle anyway as all the DLC is worth it.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Excellent top-down, twin-stick shooter powered by your music library!\n[*]Good difficulty curve that gets VERY tough at high difficulties.\n[*]Incredibly fun to play!\n[*]Great replayability - Many different enemies, bosses, gamemodes and each song is unique.\n[*]Co-op or Competetive multiplayer fun.\n[*]Gamemodes are very interesting and well done!\n[*]Custom made ships that are actually quite balanced!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Flashing lights. Very bright flashing lights to be precise. A BIG WARNING to those who suffer from photosensitivity issues.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Judgement[/h1]\nBeat Hazard gets CynicalPopcorn's HIGHLY recommended judgement with a score of 9.75/10.\n\nThe game is extremely fun with very high replayability. Difficulty is fair and the visuals are lovely. All-round well made twin-stick shooter that should not be overlooked by those who enjoy similar games like Audiosurf (music aspect) and want to try it with a bullet-hell twist.\n\nAlso, yes that is a genuine quote.

I finally decided to give Beat Hazard a try after it was available for several years on the market. It feels like a game inspired by the classic game Asteroids, but with songs from your music library playing while you control your spaceship. So the basic premise of the game is you maneuvering a spaceship while avoiding asteroids and many enemy spaceships of varying types and sizes. There are many games of this genre in a crowded market, but Beat Hazard carves out its own identity with its challenging action and allows you to take on numerous enemies and other hazards as you enjoy the rhythm of the songs of your favorite artists and built-in songs.\n\nThere had been criticism of Beat Hazard because of the lack of iTunes support. I strongly recommend buying the related Beat Hazard DLC that supports iTunes songs. I played songs from iTunes and they work just fine. The game accepts all song file types with the exception of CDs, so you will have to rip the CDs in order to play the songs. Another criticism had been that Beat Hazard doesn\u2019t seem exciting enough on slow songs. I played many slow songs, including some pop/soft rock songs, and there is enough intensity in the visuals and the mayhem to make the gameplay exciting. It is beautiful to see your spaceship\u2019s bright neon fire fill the screen while the explosions are so vibrant. There are times when the brightness of the visuals is a bit overdone, especially as the track progresses. When the visuals are too intense it can feel uncomfortable for those with sensitive eyes. Therefore, it would be best to take a break from the action if the flashing strobe feels overwhelming.\n\nThere are several gameplay modes in the game and many spaceships to choose from. The standard mode requires you to play through an entire track until it is finished. Survival mode requires you to last as long as possible while trying to play through an entire album. The spaceships have their own specific missions such as accumulating a minimum number of points without getting the death penalty that would nullify some or all of the points you had scored previously. These specific missions for spaceships add to the challenge of playing this old-school shooter while enjoying the rhythm of whatever song you are playing. There is a boss rush mode that requires you to defeat wave after wave of bosses until you have no more lives remaining. The bosses become familiar after experiencing the standard modes since bosses appear at specific points of the song. These modes are exciting in their own way, but it feels like there aren\u2019t too many other modes to further increase replay value. However, there is online play that allows you to play the various modes with a friend. The bottom of the screen adds a nice touch to the game by notifying you of your progress, your friends\u2019 progress, and other players who are looking to playing with others.\n\nYou can level up in the game and that happens as you progress through each track. After leveling up enough you will earn a new rank and you can see how you rank against other players on the global leaderboard. There is no leaderboard for individual songs like Audiosurf, but Beat Hazard\u2019s way of leveling up provides a sense of progression. I played with the mouse and keyboard setup and it plays quite well. There is the option of playing with a controller.\n\nThere are many powerups in the game. As you pick up volume and power powerups, your spaceship\u2019s lasers become increasingly powerful, but the gameplay will also intensify. The screen fills up with a large number of small enemy spaceships and large spaceships to balance the gameplay and keep you from being significantly overpowered.\n\nI think Beat Hazard is a fun game that some players may find old after playing through their favorite tracks in all the available modes.

Yes, well... not really.\n\n(Mind you, I'm in no way photosensitive like some others who have left a negative review on this game have been, and I can handle rapid flashing just fine, but if it becomes gameplay-inhibiting, then the design is absolutely flawed.)\n\nProblems with the game:\n* Often screen-filling visual effects that prevent you from seeing what is going on. You can't dodge bullets if you can't see them...\n* Overboard on the \"flashy sparkly fireworks\" effects. I mean, way overboard, and then some. It's not \"cool\", it's not \"attractive\", and it gives you a headache if you're not careful.\n* The music plays very soft. I have properly balanced music files and they simply don't play at a decent volume in the game - for a music-focused game you'd expect the audio component to be at least adequate and give priority to proper playback without having to amplify it into clipping ranges.\n* Scoring is meaningless: levels are random, so what rewards you get and points you score for a song is not dependent on the music at all. Score is determined by chance and not by skill, as a result.\n* Music-based firepower will favor even, loud songs. You get a dynamic song with breaks and softer parts and you're pretty much at the mercy of whatever random fleets of ships are thrown your way with no way to fight them off. And woe if you hit a quiet spot when a boss is thrown at you. Good luck with that, get ready for a grind.\n* Screen-filling visual effects that.. Ohwait, I already said that. :P Yes, it's a problem.

As per all good music-based games, it makes good use of music effecting gameplay. It still suffers the innate problem that slower songs are inherently easier than faster ones, but at least slower songs aren't completely boring. It seems the art got changed, abandoning the semi-realistic tone for a more icon-based, Internet 2.0 kind of look. The tractor beam enemies bring some much needed difficulty to the overall game without making it a Bullet Hell shooter like something out of Touhou, although there are still times where you can see just that happening (especially in suicide difficulty).

Being completely blasted by neon rainbows any time you do just about anything will probably make you want to rip your eyes out halfway through your first song. Even if it doesn't, there's basically no way to see any important information on the screen, like small ships and hazardous debris. More than half the time I die, it's not because I failed to dodge a bullet or enemy, but is instead because of something that I never saw at all.\nPower-ups will appear for a short duration, but the warning that they are about to disappear might as well not have been bothered being added given it's lack of usefulness. By the time they start to blink, unless you're practically on top of them already, there is no way you could possibly make it to pick them up anyways. This happens extremely frequently given that they drop randomly from enemies, and the enemies will frequently appear in extremely long strings from off screen. As a result, the enemies you kill will drop power-ups you can't reach because they are obstructed by other enemies.\nThe stream of enemies from off screen is also frustrating, as like many top-down shooters in a box, enemies can appear from off screen right where you are without warning. As a result, you are really restricted to an even smaller play area unless you'd like to risk rage and frustration.\nSong volume seems to be a cosmetic power-up with no tangible effect in game. Added to the lack of significant differences between enemy appearance (there are about 5 non-bosses, with 3 beings practically identical), the game feels like it suffers from a shocking shortage of creativity. \nAll in all, I highly recommend you avoid buying this game.

Beat Hazard claims to provide a 2D shooter that uses the music to generate the enemies, their movement, and your attack power; and were this the case it would be exactly what I was looking for.\n\nHowever the music element of this game is simply tacked onto a fairly generic 2D space shooter. The enemy spawning appears to have more to do with the amount of time you are into the level, and if the music has any affect on it, I have not noticed it. The only effect music appears to actively have on the gameplay is the speed of enemy craft, and the speed (and colourfulness) of your guns. The only other way that the music interacts with the game, are volume power-ups, which you pick up to increase the volume of the music \u2013 and that brings me to my next big complaint: The game doesn't let you enjoy the music. The music starts of almost inaudible, and only reaches acceptable volumes after 3-5 volume power-ups (which you will loose when destroyed.) Even then, the sounds of your guns, and the other craft exploding will completely drown out the music \u2013 whoever came up with the volume feature clearly didn't understand the appeal of music games.\n\nThe visual design also has its issues. The gun and explosion effects are bright and garish, filling large portions of the screen and yet don't synch with the music at all. This would be a fine design for a bullet hell game (although still heavily entrenched at the garish end of them), but the way it is executed detracts heavily from the musical aspects of the game; this is particularly true when the genre of music is more relaxed and serene. The truth is that the game as a whole does a very bad job of conveying the feel of the tracks used, caring only for the music's volume to determine enemy and bullet speeds. Say what you like about Audiosurf, but at least that game made the tracks you surfed on feel like the song that was playing \u2013 and didn't get in the way of you listening to them.\n\nI would not recommend this game, there are better examples of the two genres it is trying the fuse, and a superior version of this game can be achieved by finding a good 2D space shooter, turning the music off, and playing your own in the background.

It's the epileptic's worst nightmare. It's also faaaaaantastic.\n\nIt's only peripherally a music game. The intensity of your spaceship's firepower varies with the volume of the song playing, and supposedly the salvo of enemies is influenced by this as well but it's not apparent how this may be. Regardless, it's an exceptional one-screen shoot-em-up in the vain of Asteroids that succeeds without relying on the musical gimmick.\n\nThe shooting is loads of fun. You blast a pretty decent variety of ships and bosses into clouds of metallic debris. It's extremely satisfying picking huge enemies to pieces.

Similar to Asteroids, the perspective is top-down, and you have free reign to move your ship in any direction (however, you are limited by the borders of the screen). The ideal way to play this game is with an Xbox 360 controller, as it is a twin-stick shooter (similar to Smash TV).\n\nThe major selling point is that it is also a visualizer. So, your \"stages\" are actually music tracks. The game ships with several dance/house/edm tracks, however you can add to that listing with music saved onto your hard drive, and for $1.00, you can add iTunes and m&a support. Because it's a visualizer, everything pulsates with the beat of the music; shots, powerups, and your ships lights all thump with the beat. Because of this, certain genres resonate better with it than others (club/hip hop/dance/edm/dubstep/soul/funk/pop being the best, with metal/psychobilly/punk being the most spasmatic). Interestingly, the game will sync enemies and bosses with the music, so when a song gets to a really intense part, you may suddenly get hit with twin bosses and similarly when there's not much going on in the track, you may wind up staring at an empty screen. The game also takes more detail into the game from your music selection by making adjustments to things like enemy/bullet speed, how many of your guns fire during the quieter segments, and how fast time-based score multiplier meters fill up.\n\nThe ideal purchase to make for this game is the Mega Bundle Pack, as it contains all of the DLC (including the aforementioned iTunes/m&a licensing). These include online co-op/competitive play, new bosses, and perks that can be applied to your gameplay, and the Shadow Ops Unit DLC, which adds a rank progression system, ship-specific goals (like destroy 100 asteroids, reach 1,000,000 points in a track), leaderboards for each ship, and even opens up the ship creating system to you. The higher you rank in the Shadow Ops Unit, the more points you get in creating a ship. It also lets you select an image on your hard drive for the ship and upload your creation to the steam workshop for others to download and use. This also means that you can download ships that other users have created (I've seen quite a few Millennium Falcons, Starship Enterprises, X-Wing Fighters, and Tie Fighters, but have also seen the Planet Express Ship, ships from other shooters, and even the Tardis).\n\nHowever, due to the nature of this game's fast moving, brightly colored flashing particle effects, this is not something for epileptics to play or be around, as it will made them seize faster than Axl Rose would find a reason to not play a show. For the rest of us, the $16.99 price point for the Mega Bundle pack is really cheap.

You can use the music you have on your computer to power the battlefield as you blast away your foes.  It's a simple, but addicting game, especially with the DLC that adds the Shadow Missions (objectives for you to complete with different ships).  The gameplay is simple: you shoot the living crap out of anything that moves on-screen while trying not to get exploded.\n\nThe only major issue I have with this game is that the visuals are sometimes too distracting.  I usually turn the visual intensity option down to 50% when I play, because otherwise it actually kinda hurts my eyes.  This also makes it hard to see some of the projectiles coming towards you, resulting in some really cheap deaths where you literally couldn't see what blew you up.  Since you basically die in one hit, it can be a pain, especially if you're trying to complete a Shadow Mission.\n\nOther than that it's a load of fun to hop in and blow up enemies while listening to your favorite music.  It's well worth the bundle that includes all the DLC as well if it goes on sale.  Buying it full price really depends on how much fun you think you'll have with it.  It's definitely more hardcore than the likes of Audiosurf.

It's just the right amount of simplicity and depth... It's a basic concept, take your music, have the music generate levels that dynamically react to that music and power your weapons in kind... This basic idea has then been continously refined and improved upon until you have a really well developed fun little game to get your adreniline pumping while listening you your favourite tunes and enjoying some eyecandy.\n\nJust a heads up before we go any further, this is a very visually intense game... If you are photo sensitive this game is not for you... While it is possible the low visuals setting and monitor calibration might make the game playable for you, I wouldn't risk it. It's a great game but it is intensionally designed to explosion of flashing coloured lights... And while delightful it's not worth risking your health... For everyone else... The higher the visual intensity the higher your high score, so blow you eyes out. :-P\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the visuals are a major selling point for the game. Remember those old console demo disks and media player plug ins we used to download so we could have pretty procedural visulaisers  for our music? Well this game provides that, dials it up to 11 and then includes a damn decent if simple SHMUP as well.\n\nI've followed it since launch and it started out just simple and enjoyable. However, the developer was highly active here on the steam forums and receptive to feedback to fine tune the game and continued to develop it the right way... That is to take in that feedback and come up with their own inovative solutions to the shortcommings. For example when the community demanded the addition of powerups the developer opted to rather than shoehorn in the standard clich\u00e9 powerups seen in every shmup, to creatively create some inovative unique powerups of their own, their own system for collecting and using them and tailored existing and new enemies specifically to them to make a more dynamic interesting play experience.\n\nThe developer even went so far as to fix problems by adding new features we didn't even no we needed, but now we have them we couldn't live without them... I highly recommend getting the full package. The DLC for this game came much later but rounded out the play experience more then I could have imagined. With the core game, ultra and the shadow missions DLC you'll have a great balanced progression through the ranks as you upgrade you ship and refine your skills so you will simentaniously hit your peak in all departments right as you reach the top of the rankings, fully unlocking all the customisable  features so you having mastered the game you can fully adjust everything to suit your play style before you shift to targeting the leader boards and competing with your friends.\n\nAt time of writing I have every achievment (some easy, some hard), unlocked every feature and have invested a solid amount of time playing and mastering all the different game modes and features... And I'm not done. As I find new gems and get new songs to add to my media library I shall return to play them out repeatedly in beat hazard to the pleasure of my eyes and reflexes as well as my ears. I wouldn't spend all day playing it (now that I've completed the progression to obtain all unlockables), but it is a game I happily come back to for a few hours again and again every other week for a bit of fun and challange... Not to mention dive in to compete with my friends with from time to time.

It's just a twin-stick shooter where you shoot at asteroids and enemies while trying to avoid touching them. The game's main advertising point is that the aesthetics and enemy generation of the game are based around the music you play, where each \u201cstage\u201d is a song. For example, if you\u2019re at a loud part of the song, the game will throw a bunch of enemies at you but also increase your firepower. As a singleplayer game, it\u2019s neat to say the least. However, I recommend Beat Hazard as a multiplayer game with a friend. That way, you get that weird joy of listening to a song with your friend while also trying to not burn through all of your shared lives. It can be rather fun chaos in the game, and my friends and I would have several systems on who got to pick the next song.\nThere are a few janky aspects of Beat Hazard to make that dream happen, though. First, you need both you and your friends to the same exact song files into Beat Hazard\u2026and if you have a ton of songs, it\u2019s a rather lengthy process where the game demands to be open. Plus, the songs are all presented in one list with limited sorting options, so if you\u2019re looking for a specific song and you have a lot, you have to hope to not scroll past it.

But it isn't even part of faking expert skills.\n\nNot to mention that this game is actually rated E (for everyone) by ESRB.\n\n[h1]Here also comes my facts involving myself for this game in this review[/h1]\nI had chosen this game as my primary favorite game of the music-based procedural generation game collection because I wanted to enjoy shooting down the enemies & bosses, dodging their attacks & hulls and especially avoid losing lives & failing the music.\n\nWhat I actually enjoy in this game...is by absolutely playing my favorite video game music remixes, metal covers and medleys by Jonny Atma, DJ the S and the OverClocked ReMix community. Not just those kinds but also my favorite music from the Newgrounds Audio Portal since I've also known many of my favorite music from there since my childhood and even my favorite I Wanna Be The Guy fangames. Nintendo game, Touhou and Castlevania music for the win too!\n\nIt's also pretty funny that...I identify gender for the ships as I refer the star runner ship as a female and the dragon fire ship as a male but even every bosses as males too. But enemies are genderless or maybe males also, I decide.\n\nI also do YouTube videos of my completion runs of every songs I play in this game like replays and memories both together but on my alternate channel about getting high scores on the songs in the music powered games like this game \"Beat Hazard\".\n\nAnyway, I am hoping that I can complete all of my favorite video game music remixes/metal covers/medleys in this game ever. It will be an epic piece of the sweetest cake and even a mastery diamond medal for doing all of those on the suicidal difficulty. I'll nail it. (Get the hint about a mastery diamond medal? Yep, mastery mode from Bloons TD 5 on platforms rather than web and diamond medal from Bloons Super Monkey 2 on mobile)\n\nYou and I should actually start off with the GaMetal music of \"Beware the Forest's Mushrooms\" (from Super Mario RPG) and the Touhou Remix Project music \"Miko Xanadu\" (by DJ the S) if we are really fans of Nintendo and Touhou though.

So, \"What is Beat Hazard?\". \n\nBeat Hazard is an action/arcade game where you need to blow up shit-tons of enemy spaceships while maintaining your tiny ass ships \"one-hit KO\" HP. Sounds fun right? ...Right?\n\nOK. It might not be appealing at first sight but once you buy(or get) it and boot up the game, you'll find that you are going to need to move all your music to an easily accessible place. Because Beat Hazards file browser SUCKS! I kid you not, it really does. But worry not my friend who still has his/her eyesight, because once you get the hang of it, you will easily pick the song you want and start sending those spaceships to space junkyard, I guess.\n\nAlright, we booted up the game. Closed the game. Moved every piece of music we have in our PC to a better place. Opened up the game again. Picked the song. Now what? Now it's the time to have fun! Simply click anywhere to shoot while using WASD(Honestly I don't remember if I changed the key bindings so go check your settings before hopping into the game.) to move around. You might find that the power of your weapons, as well as the speed of the game, is dependent on the music that is currently playing. Ehem... [h1][b]BEAT[/b] Hazard[/h1]\n\nWhile playing the game you will die a lot, but don't rage you'll learn to dodge while slowly turning your loyal eyeballs into fried cheeseballs. No one said there is no price but if you really want to see for 2 more days go ahead and turn down the intensity of effects. Actually turn down the intensity because when you max it out(200% is the max value) like I did. You can't see shit, there will be literally too much bullshit on your screen. Enemies, FAKIN ASTEROIDS, You and last but not least bullets(or Danmaku \u5f3e\u5e55 if you prefer the original usage or you are a weeaboo like me). \n\nLet us start with the enemies, there are 6 type of enemies listed by their difficulty to take down;\n\n\u2022Small grey ships, their duty is being as annoying as they can be while trying to flank and kamikaze you.\n\n\u2022Medium sized red decalled white ships, their duty is sometimes shooting and sometimes trying to kamikaze you.\n\n\u2022Big blue ships, their duty is shooting Homing Yellow Danmaku which can be destroyed if shot upon.\n\n\u2022Armada(that's what I call them), their duty is coming in sizes of 20+ and cover the whole screen while shooting at you at once from all sides.\n\n\u2022Boss, not much to say simple boss just shoot its weak points.\n\n\u2022Twin Boss, little brothers of the Boss.\n\nAbout the asteroids in the game, what they are known for is getting in your way of having fun. Whether they spawn in the middle of the most [i]epicest[/i] guitar solo of all times or bump into your ship in the most unsuspecting time. You won't expect it because you are going to be dealing with 513 enemies at once. [spoiler]FUCK ASTEROIDS[/spoiler]\n\nNow let's talk about how the game uses your music to spawn enemies. Based on my observations the bassier the sound is the more action you'll get. I think the best example would be Orion from Metallica. There is a bass passage in the beginning of the song. This makes the game think \"IT'S SHOWTIME BABY\" and you'll end up getting your face melted before the song even started. Orion is the hardest song I have ever played in this game. Considering the piece is 8 minutes long with almost 4 minutes of bass solo. This means 4 minutes of non-stop action. [spoiler]My biggest disappointment was the system [b][i]almost[/i][/b] only takes bass as a measure. I personally enjoy listening to Power Metal, a genre which doesn't prioritise bass over treble. That's what you'll get FAKIN ASTEROIDS IN YOUR FAKIN GUITAR SOLO[/spoiler]\n\n\nThe game is overall great and fun to play with lots of replayability. You can basically play until you run out of music if that's ever going to happen. The downside is you need to be relaxed and very careful like you are going to beat the world record of being careful to spot every [strike]little annoying pieces of fucks[/strike] Small grey ships and all the Danmaku while there is literally shitstorm happening in your poor screen.

This is, without a doubt, the worst \"play your own music!\" game I've ever had the displeasure of trying. I don't think I could actually imagine a worse music based game, which is why I find myself reeling at the fact it has so many positive reviews.\n\nFor starts, the biggest thing is that this game probably functions about 30% around your music, that's it. For a game supposedly based around the songs you pick, it has almost no relation at all towards them. The only real thing that ties in to it are enemy spawns and your bullets. When the beat slows, so does your rate of fire. W o w. \n\nSo what makes this game so awful? I love bright lights, they're catchy and hold your attention. This? I don't even have epilepsy and I think I had a small seizure. The music can be at the lowest point with the slowest beat, and the screen will still be flashing like you were watching the video feed of a camera thrown at a rave. It doesn't fit in the slightest. You can be listening to the fastest part of a song where enemies are everywhere, but the screen will just be black and softly flash white. Suddenly out of nowhere at all, the screen will just explode into a cancerous color-fest that will make you regret having your monitor on at all. I have no issues with things like this is they have a purpose. There is. No. Purpose. It doesn't fit the beat. It doesn't fit ANYTHING! It's just THERE. For no reason other than \"wOw tHIs is rEAL coOL! FlaSHiNG lIGHts ArE GreaT For thE KIds?! yEAH!\" \n\nThis game truly feels like a free game you'd find on the Xbox Aracade for free, except this game is 10 dollars and makes you pay money to use a pretty common file type. That alone should get this game a negative review from people, but seemingly not. Everything in this game screams \"This is my third Game-Maker creation and I have no idea what I'm doing!\" It feels like it's made by a really hyper child who thinks that spastic lighting and \"hardcore\" menu transitions are the way of the future. \n\nPeople keep asking how such awful games keep making it on Steam, but then I see things like this getting 4k Overwhelmingly positive reviews and I have my answer.", "timestamp_created": 1522900053, "timestamp_updated": 1522900053, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433959394693374634", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "40942017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083070847", "num_games_owned": 553, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1531800565}, "language": "english", "review": "Going through my entire steam library and writing reviews.\n\nI don't remember purchasing this game but it's quite fun to sit down and play a little asteroid-esque game while listening to your favourite tunes.

I love twin stick shooters and I love listening to music so it seems like a natural pairing.  The game is fun initially and does seem to sync to music, particulary more uptempo or aggressive songs that have a building to a peak structure about them.  Slower songs, jazz, classical and the like don't really work that well.  The game has built in support for several internet radio stations playing more obscure tracks which is nice, although tbh I usually play with my own tracks.\n\nYou'll unlock powerups and boosters as you go, and once you get a few it's easy to really rack up your scores.  The game is not all that challenging though.  Within a couple of hours I had unlocked everything, and tbh I'm not even that great at these kind of shooters. It's also very repetious, you'll see the same kind of enemies in the same sequence with mostly the same bosses regardless of what music you're playing.   It gets old after awhile.\n\nUltimately I quit playing so much as I moved to subscription based music services like Spotify and Google Play Music.  The game doesn't support these.  Since I rarely buy or download music any more I'm left with my old library to play on it.  Half the reason I liked the game was that it gave me something to do with my hands while I delved into new music, since it doesn't support the platforms I now use it's kind of fell by the wayside in the last few years.  \n\nIf you like twin stick shooters there are way better options out there.  If you like listening to new music while playing a game, and  you buy genuine music files it's worth ten bucks.  But don't expect much of a challenge or much variety, and be forewarned that if your not listening to upbeat pop, electronic or hard rock/metal it likely won't be that great of an experience.  I'm going to say not recommended because the audience that would like it and can play it seems small.  But if you fit the above niche go for it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517770502, "timestamp_updated": 1517770502, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507369577884674072", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "39829736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120870180", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1517702528}, "language": "english", "review": "no", "timestamp_created": 1517702794, "timestamp_updated": 1517702794, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415737926959991455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "39700061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028778610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1359273600}, "language": "english", "review": "Havent played this game in YEARS.

While I certainly would have liked more ships, bosses, power-ups, perks, and gamemodes (all of which are boasted in the DLC, which, again, I did not purchase), the amount I paid seems to fit the bill, and I'd personally prefer a smaller selection rather than an oversaturation of needless content. (Come on, who wants to bother memorizing boss attack patterns in a music game?)\n\nThere are certainly better games out there - better shoot 'em ups, better music games, what have you - but Beat Hazard should be treated as something meant to enhance your musical experience rather than as a standalone game. If you want to get lost in the game, certainly try something else more suited to your tastes. But if you're ready to get lost in your own music library again, don't rule it out just yet.\n\n(This game was purchased on sale, and I have not purchased the DLC expansion.

It offers up an engaging way to listen to your own tunes.\n\nThis game does have many flaws in my opinion. The blurb advertises a \"unique ebb and flow based on the music\". While this is technically true, even if it's unique it still feels all samey. No matter what song you're listening to, it's all the same basic experience. Sometimes, its dedication to going with the music works against it. This game is definitely more optomized for certain song structures and that makes playing through slower, quieter songs a slog. I could technically play through any song, but once I got to songs like FourFiveSeconds or Big Iron, the game kinda drudged along at an intensely slow pace.\n\nSometimes, the intensity of the game feels off with the music. As mentioned before, Beat Hazard really shines with a certain structure of song, most easily replicated by dubstep or any song that has a big drop as that is when the game can fluently change the intensity of the battle. However, sometimes it felt really off. Several times, when I was listening to quieter sections of songs, a big boss-like enemy comes to fight despite the calmer music and mood. At other times, when the beat drops in an electronic song, enemies are nowhere to be seen and it's just me and my super intense lasers versus some slow floating rocks.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the game, that might just be a me thing, is the visuals. When you boot up the game it warns about its use of strobing and a possibility of seizures. Now I haven't gotten a seizure from this game (yet), but the intensity of the visuals makes a drag to play for extended periods of time. Every time I've stopped playing, I've had a minor headache (nothing really serious just needed to step away from the computer for some time). \n\nDespite all these complaints, Beat Hazard really is the best way to play a twin stick shooter on steam simply for the music integration and I would still recommend it if your looking for a way to chill out (despite the intensity of the game) and listen to some toons.\n\nTL;DR - Beat Hazard is the ideal twin-stick shooter for its music integration despite not perfectly working with the music and its overly-involved, bright, strobing visual style.", "timestamp_created": 1514356083, "timestamp_updated": 1514356083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677700519561767578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "7758518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022075554", "num_games_owned": 1185, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1543, "last_played": 1647131412}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Linux Version Review [/h1]\n\nThis is basically an Astroids game on steriods that is litterally powered by your music.

Normal play has you selecting a single song, acting as one stage; this includes five different difficulties of play. You have until the end of the song to survive and score as many points as possible. Survival takes a list of your songs and plays them all in succession, the aim being to survive as long as possible while scoring points, ending when you have no lives left. Chill Out mode allows you to casually play along to songs without limited lives, enjoying the game without stress. Chill Out mode also employs the difficulty options of normal play. On top of all of this is an addictive little rank progression system.\nWith the addition of the Ultra DLC, however, this game becomes a completely different beast. New enemies, new weapons, the addition of perks and an upgrade system, and new multiplayer and Boss Rush modes all amount to being well worth the $5. There are also some smaller changes as well, such as your ship no longer moving with momentum \u00e0 la Asteroids, which makes the game much more playable, and seemingly some changes to hitboxes.\nAll in all, I certainly recommend buying the base game, and cannot recommend buying the Ultra DLC along with it. Note that there is seperate DLC for the support of iTunes files, as well. I would also highly recommend a controller.\n\nEdit: I'm back years later, with tons of new music.

Mixed with the Seizure-Inducing Visuals (warning btw) that can be boosted all the way to 200%, this game is made to be more for the Rock/Techno fans. \n\nYou Control a Ship and play through songs pre-installed in the game's Album. As stated before, the Music is the Determining Factor on how fast the game will go and stop, as the music used will also Determine the Length of the level you need to survive in, if it's the Standard Mode. The Music controls just about everything, including your Ship's Gun Strength and Movement Speed, as well as Bullet Speed. The Faster and more Intense/Loud the Music is, the faster and stronger everything is. \n\nMultiplayer is a Mixed Bag of good and bad however. If for Friends, then Multiplayer can be good. If for the Public Multiplayer, then it's not great. There are barely anybody wishing to play this game Public Multiplayer to begin with due to DLCs making some players better than others, in a bad way, but i'll get to those in the next section. As long as there is an Even Playing-Field for all players, then Multiplayer can be fun. However, that can Rarely happen, resulting in the lack of Public Multiplayer Games atm. This is more of a Singleplayer game to begin with regardless, so don't have Multiplayer be one of those reasons for getting this game.\n\n\nNow that the main, Overall General Game is taken care of, ONTO THE DLCS! This Section is PARAMOUNT to how much fun you want in your Beat Hazard Experience, so Read up! The best to least needed DLCs shall be listed in order from top to bottom.\n\nFirst and Foremost, while a situational and very optional DLC, the $0.99 DLC of the Ability to Put extra music-type files into your Beat Hazard Game. TL;DR, For Single Player, and with the very low price of $1 to do it make it the most Highly Recommended DLC to get, unless if the files it's allowing support over you don't use. Even With the Ultra DLC, the game only has 23 Songs, so if you really want to get maximum Enjoyment, The Ability to Stack on Loads and Loads of songs to play on will give Beat Hazard MUCH more Replayability. Again, this DLC will vary from person to person because some may use .mp3 and .wav music files, so it's not needed, but for people who mainly uses iTunes files and what-not, it's a must for them. Something to note, however: the only way you can play Multiplayer with your songs is if everyone else has A: The Same Song name, and B: The Same Song FILE Type (.mp3, .ogg, .wav, etc.) Unless it's for Friends, Multiplayer utilizing this is as unlikaly as you winning the lottery. As stated before, you'll usually want to stick to Friends-Only for Multiplayer, as from what I've experienced in Public Multiplayer, It's not the best.\n\nSecondly, the Ultra DLC. This is the Pack you need if you are looking for all of that Challange you may/may not be yearning for. While it's $4.99, and for a small game like this, the Ultra DLC is quite Game-Changing. This unlocks the Perk System where, if you level up, you can now pick from a variety of Perks to unlock such as ones made to increase Score, obtaining new Weapons such as Micro Missiles and Reflect Shields, and even getting unlockable difficulty levels, which are all VERY useful if you do not plan on getting the Shadow Ops DLC, which will be later. This also gives New Enemies, More Bosses, and Boss Rush Mode. While Boss Rush Mode can, sorta, kinda, a LIIIIIITLE bit be abused to level up fast (which I do Not Condone, nor like, the use of doing,) The new Mode can be quite the experience, and can become Hell-on-Earth, or, in this Case, Hell-in-Space, VERY Fast if you cannot keep up, making it a good challange the longer you survive. This also adds in Co-oP, and Head-to-Head, which is Competitive for whoever can get the most points. While this IS second, it is nearly as needed of a DLC as the Custom Track DLC explained first, with the only 2 reasons of that being Price and Player Skill needed for Ultra.\n\nNow comes the worst of them, and this time an Un-needed DLC that I Do Not Recommend if you get Ultra, and that is the Shadow Ops DLC. The Shadow Ops DLC is, in my theory, the main reason Public Multiplayer is Lacking. From what I have seen from Multiplayer, many of the ships are a Much more OP Version of the Standard Version of the Ship, with the downside of a Larger Hitbox the Majority of the time (exception is the Mosquito Ship). While it may give the game a sense of Completion, it gives Unnessessary Ships that would Kill the purpose of the Ultra DLC, and with a $5 Price tag as well, I cannot recommend this DLC over the Ultra DLC, for 2 main reasons; Bad Synergy, and Less Needed out of the 2. The Reason why the Shadow Ops DLC mixes bad w/ Ultra is that the Shadow Ops DLC makes the game more Easy, as it gives better firepower, killing many of the reasons to even GET Ultra in the first place. If you're good enough, you can, Like me, and potentially many otjhers, complete Tracks on Suicidal only needing the Standard Ship. Even if it DIDN'T make things easier, it sure as heck not making it harder for you. I've seen games where i see people using a few of the Shadow Ops Ships and other Custom ships from the Steam Workshop, and only Rolls with the Reflect Shield, because their ship is so good they don't even NEED the Micro Missiles or Ultra Beams the Ultra DLC Gives, which are two VERY Useful Weapon Perks. If it makes the game that much easier in the higher difficulties, you shouldn't be playing on the higher difficulties to begin with if you wanted a more Casual Play of Beat Hazard, even IF the missions of obtaining the Ships are very Tough, making this DLC not needed if you already have Ultra, which i Recommend Much Higher than this. \n\nTL;DR: Great Game Casually and Challenging, but not in both worlds for DLC.

Your music (or internet radio!) determines the stage!\n\nEverything from enemy spawning, to your gunfire rate/intensity, to the movement speed of all asteroids/enemies/projectiles, plays off of the music. This makes some songs boring to play, and others nearly impossible.\nOn a personal note, I definitely feel like any possible music you can grab works with it.\n\nPros:\n+Multiple difficulties, and modes, for any taste.\n+Use your music! \n+Tight controls.\n+Good visuals.\n+Random boss fights, based on music (tempo changes? Not sure).\n\nCons:\n-Niggling to buy the Ultra DLC when you try to close the game, feels like I paid for a demo.\n-Limited gameplay beyond the different modes. Would love to see some kind of story mode.\n-Small enemy variety.\n\nNeutral:\n+-Overly intense visuals can make it hard to tell what you're doing.

I'm extremely torn. And it sucks that I have to write such an awkward, ambiguous review.\n\nWhile I do enjoy the game tremendously and was having tons of fun to start, I quickly found myself reeling with unexpected bouts of headaches and vertigo that lasted overnight after playing. As far as I can tell, there is no way to lower the visual effects low enough to safe levels to allow me to play comfortably. Due to this, I'm currently pending a refund on this otherwise fun, entertaining game.\n\nThis caught me massively off-guard, as I have never had a history of vertigo, seizures, or other mental-related issues while playing games. If a way comes to lower the effects to a reasonable level, then I would absolutely enjoy to re-purchase the game, even if I must get it that second time at full price. It's worth that much. But until then, the game may as well be entirely unplayable. It's not worth getting consistent hours-long bouts of vertigo just to play a single game.\n\nThe actual game is great, and I would recommend it to anyone who can take the overly-crazy visual effects. This is the first game to ever give me mental issues in only a mere few playthroughs of certain songs, and playing multiplayer with a friend was the breaking point for me. And I can't stress this enough: I'm extremely upset that I am, on a physical level, unable to play this game. I [i]want[/i] to be able to play this game so much. The few playthroughs before the vertigo kicked in were extremely fun and cathartic. The enemies legitimately got challenging during faster paced songs. The aesthetics are beautiful and it's clear that a lot of time and effort went into this game.\n\nHowever, if the trade-off is severe headaches and dizziness, then I simply can't consider it worth it to me. I won't let that cloud my judgment on the game as a whole, and once again re-iterate in this review that I [i]do[/i] recommend this game at the end of the day. Although this game was clearly not for me, I encourage others to see this game for themselves. If you can take the effects, you'll find a satisfying, simple, and extremely fun game.

I've always been interested in the idea of music modifying a game to produce a game where you feel like you play your music. \n\nAnd honestly... Beat Hazard isn't that game.  It suffer the same fate as all these procedurally generated music games, like Audiosurf, where the music doesn't have a strong connection to the game you're playing.  When you play Beat Hazard, there is limited connectability to the the music. \n\nThe Music in Beat Hazard pretty much affects the \"intensity\" of the game.   If you play some music with a high BPM enemies will move at a faster rate than a low BPM.  But even playing Happy Hardcore and other fast BPM music, the game doesn't appear broken, which is a good thing.  A VERY good thing, as I'd hate to see the game limit what types of music it can play. \n\nIn addition, the game comes with a built in soundtrack, something Audiosurf doesn't really do, so at least you can play exactly what song the developer was thinking of when you play the game, and the fact is... it works and by that I mean very well.  There a variety of songs chosen but slow songs have a different feel from fast songs.  That's good. \n\nBut you'll play through the 20 songs or so and then you'll have to play your music?  Right?    Well... not unless you want to, though you can.  There's also internet radio!   At least my copy (which is from the original launch) came with a few stations already set up and adding more is relatively easy, EXCEPT it requires editing a file, so steam boxes and anyone playing in a big picture mode has to go through a few hoops to make it work.  It's not awful, but it's an annoying few steps that I wish wasn't required. \n\nHowever the build in internet radio works, and works well, rather than \"play a song\" you instead play a time battle, 4 minutes up to 20 minutes I believe (and a survival mode for when you want to see how far you can go).  And again, it's YOUR choice.  I chose an electronica station, so I was loving the music and the game, and it worked... really well.   Well except for the fact there's a little disconnect between the game and the song, but you can use internet radio, and listen to great music as you play.\n\nSo what's the game like?  It's a bit like Geometry wars.  Rather than fighting geometry shapes, you're instead blasting ships and flying dodging their attacks.  It's quite similar to bullet hell games, but there's a few major changes.  First the game isn't that brutally hard, and gives you multiple difficulty options (including a few you can only unlock through a perk system).  Second, there's power ups.  Enemy ships when destroyed can drop different items, some of them are for points, some of them are weapons you can trigger, and finally there's \"volume\" and \"power\".  Power does exactly what you think, it makes your ship strong, however Volume is different.  It increases the sound of the song you're listening to.  At the beginning your music is quite, but as you volume up the sound increases so you can hear your song at full volume.  This also affects the power of your ship (I think defensively) and when you max both you get a special mode, so both of these power ups are important. \n\nWhile that disconnect from the music for the game doesn't make this the game I dream of, the fact is the gameplay of the game is fun, and there's a decent connection when you're listening to music and what's happening in the game.  If a song goes from slow to fast and back, you'll notice enemies speeding up and slowing down.  The connection could be better, if you play a song two or three times, it's random how enemies will appear and attack.   However the gameplay itself is solid, and you are able to listen to music you like and have it make a minor effect on the game you're playing. \n\nBut the game underneath is just a fun game.  I love geometry wars, and Beat Hazard I think might actually beat Geometry wars for replayability.  I recommend this game not because it's a stunning success in the world of music games, but because it's a fantastic twin stick shooter with a lot of depth.  The two DLCs (Shadow Operations Unit and Ultra) are both excellent add ons, and being able to get the whole set for under 20 bucks is a good value.", "timestamp_created": 1479162505, "timestamp_updated": 1479929214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586440205574035645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "26323172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211054780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1489691384}, "language": "english", "review": "When i was a kid i always dream of battling aliens in a spaceship dogfight while listening to my favorite music tracks.

I even plan to get the DLC this December.\n\nYou can literally just plug your laptop/computer into a projector and play this game at a party and no one will be disappointed. Unless you die a lot, which means you can't shoot for the few seconds before respawning, which means the glowy things will stop existing for a few seconds.\n\nPro Tip : Before playing, you can Tone down the visual effects. On default it's 100% and might hurt your eyes if you play for more than 2 hours straight. Or you could wear sunglasses instead, it's way cooler.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit : After playing a while, I noticed something. First of all, Beat Hazard 2 is in Beta Access at the time im writing this review. Now, I know, that implies that THIS GAME won't be updated, since Beat Hazard 2 is apparently functionally similar to Beat Hazard, and Beat Hazard 2 is in early access BECAUSE the developer wants to add more features to beat hazard 2 to make it a worthy enough sequel. It puzzles me why the devs couldn't just update this one instead, but I guess making a seperate title would mean more money from the same amount of consumers.\n\n\n\nAnyways, I think there's things that can be polished about this game. Specifically, I want to talk about how the selling points of the game clash with each other. Trust me, I know this is somewhat supposed to be both Bullet Hellish Shooter Arcade game, and that's fun, but it's other selling point is it's visual effects and how it can Generate patterns based on sound frequency, much like Audiosurf trying to procedurally create obstacles and boxes based on the music\n\nProblem is, these two selling points need to work together. Our ships shoot a lot of bullets and that's awesome. The default ship can spread based on the music. On top of that, those bullet stream lines vary a lot, and it glows in a very unique way, being suddenly very big and flashy and then shrinking down. Again, according to the beat of the music.\n\n\nBut the problem with this approach is that you can't really see the enemy bullets, which is a bad thing to have in a shooter/bullet hell. I know BH fans would say \"The bullets are a very bright red and they have flare-lines coming off them too, they're like red stars with thick lines going out\" , but the thing is, our bullets' colors also varies. When purple clashes with red, I can't see the streams of bullets. The glow [b] [i] [u] of our own bullets greatly over-shadow (or over-light) the enemies' bullets. [/u] [/i] [/b]\n\nI know, if I want to see visual effects of my music, first of all, I should just play Chill out since I have infinite Lives. If I want the visuals to be greater, I can pop it up to 200%. If I don't wanna die, just set the difficulty to Easy instead of Suicidal.\n\nBut the thing is, SUICIDAL does improve the quality of visuals. The amount of enemy, the patterns they come in and the bullets they shoot ALL improve the hectic-ness of the screen. \nAnd secondly, I myself bought this game for it's bullet hell aspect. It's a shame that this game is like 80% visuals and 20% \"oh, its a bullet hell because you can't see the enemy bullets, which is totally fair game design. if you can't play, don't play\". Like no. I play bullet hell games so i KNOW that I can beat this game on suicidal if there were no glowy effects. Again it clashes with the other selling point of the game. If i tone done the visuals and play the game seriously as a shooter, it nullifies the purpose of seeing this as a visualizer/music based glow-program. [b] [u] [i] I want to experience both at the same time. [/i] [/u] [/b]\n\nBut I think this can be fixed by doing one simple thing.\nIt's a suggestion for the developers.\n\n[b] Make these toggle-able options: [/b]\n\n[b] [i] [u] \n-A small, invisible circle around every enemy bullet will not contain glows from our bullets, in the circle's radius\n-Enemy Bullets will have a different color than our current bullet color, and changes accordingly when our bullet color changes.\n-Enemy Bullets's glowing effect will have a different color than the bullet itself, and a different color from our bullets. At all times.\n[/u] [/i] [/b]\n\n\nThis would RAPIDLY improve this game by making it an actual shooter/bullet hell instead of \"Oh, the reason its hard is because you literally won't be able to see anything. maybe you should change your settings and game mode\"\n\n\nStill a good game, but eh. I gotta put this out there.\nAlso again, since Beat Hazard 2 exists, i guess this game just stopped it's updates then. If none of these options are implemented in BH2, I won't buy it.

The first thing that greets you when you open the game is an epilepsy warning typical of most games with any level of visual intensity. I sort of brushed it off as I normally do, and then BOOM THE MENU OPENED AND STROBES STARTED PULSING INTO MY EYES AND THE MENU WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO LOOK AT. This is Beat Hazard's ultimate downfall, the place where it needlessly shoots itself in the face for no reason whatsoever; the game is a fucking eyesore.\n\nThere's a niche in indie gaming for games that let you use your own music, with notable examples being Crypt of the Necrodancer and Audiosurf (both of those games are a lot better by the way check em out if this disappointed you), so combining it with a shoot em up is a logical conclusion. What isn't logical however, is combining that with the experience of going to a rave while you're really hung over. Literally for the entirety of the time you're playing the game, painfully intense strobe flashes will be going off originating from every dead enemy, every bullet that you shoot, and I think even just ambiently. This combines with motion blur that occurs when killing a large enemy to make the game's visuals COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to make out VERY OFTEN.\n\nNow, maybe it's just me, but if I can play VR games for a while without feeling sick, why did this game make my eyes literally physically hurt after a measely 10 minutes? Well you see, the game offers a visual intensity score that you can turn up or down. Up offers a higher score, apparently rewarding players who like feeling like they're going to throw up, and down offers a mildly more tolerable experience. I say mildly because even the least intense setting was enough to make me angry enough to write all this. Playing a game that makes you feel physically ill isn't fucking fun in the slightest.\n\nThe game would be decent if it weren't for this strobe shit! I don't know why there's no option to turn it off in the graphics! Even the lowest intensity setting makes me feel like my eyeballs are gonna roll out of my head. Why would you design a game like this??? \n\nSo in short, this game is great if you're already blind and don't mind that playing this will make you blind, since you're already blind. If you're not blind, don't buy this game. Imagine the experience of sitting really close to the TV, so close you're almost touching, for the entire time you're playing. It's like that but worse.\n\nFuck the people who made this.

I liked it but I only had the demo. So when I found out this game was 80% off on steam, I had to buy it. And, I actually like it a lot more then I did when I played the demo on my PlayStation 3.

There is rainbow flashing lights EVERYWHERE and I am not over exaggerating. \n\n2: The fact you need a seperate DLC to use songs from ITunes. Look, I get it, the developers probably forgot to put it in the final release, and sure, it\u2019s only a $0.99 DLC. But the point of the matter is that it should of been in the game FROM THE START. \n\n3: It does have steam workshop, but to use the workshop, you need to buy another DLC. WHY!!!!! Why not let people who get the game normally without all the DLC. It would of been a lot better. \n\n4: On my computer at least, the game has a tendency to crash sometimes. Maybe because I have too many steam workshop ships? I don\u2019t know.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOther then those 4 problems, I actually recommend this game.

Say EDM or Electro-Swing, where there is one main beat to listen to and then the background music or beats to accompany it. But what it may not do well at recognizing is say DOOM soundtrack or metal music in general, where a lot of instruments are used together rather loudly at the same time. You will usually just get a bunch of enemies alongside firerate when played.\nBut why am I recommending this if it has what seems to be a big flaw?\nThat would be because it's concept is fine, it's quite alright, and it plays well still.

I covered my eyes, and I could still see the flashes. It gets even worse once the rock music kicks up and the flashes become even brighter and more intense and rapid.

When creating your ship, you can choose from several attributes such as the ship's size, how fast/slow it accelerates, top speed, how fast/slow it decelerates, how strong the bullets are, how fast the bullets move, position of the guns, whether or not you repel or attract perks, how many beams (1-3), and more.  You also get to set up to three missions for your creation so you can make them easy, hard, or a mix.  As you gain higher ranks, you unlock some nice cosmetic attributes such as flares and engine thrust colour. It really is a lot of fun and it gives you new ways to enjoy Beat Hazard.\n\nAny song with the Shadow OPs icon next to it has a chance to spawn what you need for missions. Additional info from a quote from Starg: \"The 'play random track' and 'one I've not played before' will also automatically choose a song that fits the current mission criteria.\"\n\n\nOriginal recommendation I wrote for the game (23 July 2013):\n\nI bought this before the sale ended, after having played the demo, and I have to say, it's pretty damn fun. I explode a lot but that's part of the fun for me, destruction to all!!! mwahahaha. The game is wicked cool and I'm glad I bought the complete package so that I have all the nuts & bolts to fiddle with. It's interesting trying out different songs from my computer, some of them get so intense that there's so much going on on the screen that I lose track of, well, everything. Some of my songs have lulls in them where I'm sitting in space twiddling my thumbs getting the Daredevil (and the other one, I forget the name), counting up.

There is no specific reason to get all the unlocks after all.\n\nI'd give it a 8,5/10 because of the annoying radio bug (maybe only appearing to me) and the replay value (40 hours for few bucks is quite okay i guess).\n\nHOWEVER if you want to enjoy the game to the full potential i would really recommend getting the DLCs as well.

It's pretty well optimized and doesn't require anything. It is just as noobfriendly as it is challenging for some Counter-Striker Swedish E-sport player.\n\n - CONS - \n\nThe game's effects is both a blessing and a curse, the curse about it is when it actually gets in the way if you put it on too high % of the effects. The game can also slowdown if you have too much stuff on the screen if you're using a lower PC-Rig.\nI am also gonna note that be careful when you're using a controller because at one point I had the controller in and put it out and the game just flipped out and was on the xbox controller menu like you constantly pressed the A button aswell as going down in the menu automaticly, maybe it is my controller config but that's a warning nonetheless.\n\n- CONCLUSION -\n\nOverall the problems with the controllers are gone and it's definetly a fun and amazing game to try out if you're just bored and want to listen to music. Do not play this if you have a confirmed epilepsi. I had Epilepsi when I was a child but it is gone for me but that's a good advice.

At first I didn't get why there was no music on the first game, and then I got VOL's and nearly shattered my eardrums, it's a first time thing, but I think there could at least be a first-time warning. I also began to realize that my music was being drowned out by explosions and gunfire, which can be turned off, but I think they're a bit much to begin with. There are some cool options, my entire library works perfectly (with replay gain, that's definitely a big plus), and this game is definitely worthy of the seizure warning on the front, if you haven't already gathered that. I think this game would be pretty good for passing the time, especially after you get a new album or something. Thing is, I got the entire bundle on slae for $5, and while this is a great game, I would pay the $10, but I really think that should inculde the shadow ops stuff and the ultra stuff as well. The ship creator that comes with shadow ops is very intuitive from what I've seen (I haven't made anything yet), but it looks like you can upload any image and tweak the stats to your liking. Issue being, again, I think that should be built into the game rather than DLC. Visually the game is fantastic, but I think the whole theme could be wrapped together a little nicer, as it's a little all-over-the-place. In game it looks very nice, and I LOVE how the clouds and stars pulse to the music: that aspect is perfect. What isn't perfect is that the enemies don't sync into the music as good as they could, and it seems like, in comparison, Symphony does a bit of a better job, but I've only seen videos, so I can't confirm that. The perks system is cool, but I think there could be more, as your selection is kind of limited, and I also flew through a ton of ranks really quickly (and I'm not super good), so maybe those should be harder to get. Also, it will randomly go through the included music in the menu, which I think isn't.. exactly... adequate.... Overall I think it's a neat casual-to-hardcore game with some great replayability and a price that could come down just a bit.", "timestamp_created": 1404178440, "timestamp_updated": 1404178440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "10981889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042720525", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 606, "last_played": 1492219030}, "language": "english", "review": "Why are you even reading this, just buy it.

Modern effects meets old skool arcade gameplay. If Galaga was invented today this game would be it. If you're a fan of the acrade syle or want a bit of nostalgia with a modern twist, then this game is for you. The basic idea on which the gameplay is based doesn't change, but the in-game options, level ups, currency and extras add a little variety to mix it all up nicely enough to entertain. Initially the gameplay feels tricky if not strange and unintuitive, however over time it becomes a bit more like second nature rather than stressful frustration.\n\nGame ambiance: n/a\n\nReliability/Stability: 10/10\nNo crash or instability issues to report.\n\nStory/Plot: n/a\n\nConcept: 7/10\nArcade style games like this have been available since the 70's. To think that a new one can be created today, so successfully, is almost astonishing.  The classic arcade space-themed gameplay is offset with the  original idea of not only incorporating your own music playlist, but having the game react and respond to the music. This certainly brings a fun new perspective to this genre.\n\nConcept execution: 7/10\nWith many features such as multilayer online co-op gameplay with friends, perks, power-up's and a variety of single player modes, this game will keep you busy for a while. Or at least, as lite fun goes, it'll entertain you enough until you decide which major title you want to play next. \n\nTextures: 5/10\nGenerally speaking the textures in Beat Hazard are average for a game, but not underdeveloped. You could say they are just enough and nothing more. This can be forgiven however as the focus of this game is more about beat triggered special effects and skill rather than mind blowing textures. \n\nModelling: 5/10\nAgain, the modelling isn't necessarily the main aspect of this game, and again like the textures, it is just enough. They are enough to allow the game experience to be enjoyable and that's the whole point.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nThe special effects in this game are dizzying, strobing and seizure inducing. Glorious if you like it, hideous if you don't. Either way you can't deny it's extremely colorful and eye -twitchingly pretty. Turn the room lights off, the screen brightness up and strap yourself into your favorite spaceship!\n\nSound: 6/10\nThe sound isn't too bad, given the premise of this game revolves around music. It's what you'd expect from an arcade game but with a more modern production quality. Love it or hate it the volumetric and situational dynamics are there, perhaps a little overdone and exaggerated, but then it does have to stand side-by-side with the huge visuals. If you enjoy shooting spaceships with big audible bangs and explosions then you'll defiantly have fun here. \n\nMusic: 10/10\nI have to give this 10/10 for music because it's comprised  from my personally playlist. You will too unless you couldn't care less about music, in which case this game might not be to your taste.\n\nAdjustable shadow mapping: No\nBonus/Extras: none\n", "timestamp_created": 1404136456, "timestamp_updated": 1404136456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "10968557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031864470", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1077, "last_played": 1609674306}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've ever wondered what Pink Floyd's laser shows would look like if Michael Bay was involved this is it.

A radically fun experience powered by your own music. The description of the game made me hope to have a racing and heart-pounding experience much like audiosurf, but it felt more like drinking a Red Bull compared to doing cocaine.\n\nTo put it bluntly, Beat Hazard is a space shooter. Your lazers, the enemies spawn points, and their flight patterns, are all dictated by your music. You only have about 2 powerups that just change the potency of your weapons, and the volume of your music. You collect money, which is used to buy and upgrade perks, that only increase your score and nothing else. You 'rank up', a leveling system, based on your scores from the songs you've played, but don't get much out of it.\n\nAll in all, Beat Hazard is a seizure-enducing, messy, and underwhelming experience. Only electronic music could really fit the game's theme, and the game by itself is entirely obsolete without the DLC. And even THAT is obsolete thanks to Beat Hazard Ultra.

You can turn the intensity down -enough to ensure that you can easily spot targets and hazards-  but not really get rid of it. That would kind of ruin the game- the intense  is both its visual style and its identity, in a way.\n\nIt's all about letting the scenes wash over you, subconciously taking in the location of all the enemies, bullets and yourself, while your music swells and dips.

This is my go-to game whenever I just want to zone out and kill some time playing something while listening to music, but don't feel like starting a new game or concentrating on a story, etc. This is my Tetris.\n\nThis perhaps isn't the best game if you only want to kill a *little* time, since it plays your music collection (and therefore has the best sound track ever), everytime you say \"I'll quit after this round!\" it goes and picks yet another great track and you end up saying \"Well... maybe after this one!\"\n\nWhat I love about this game is that can be customised to suit your mood - harder difficulties are *HARD*, easier difficulties are easy. The intensity of the game depends on the intensity of the music track you play. You can unlock perks and assign them to help in different ways. After a high score? Put your perks into score multipliers and sacrifice the extra weapons. Feel like a challenge? Assign your perks to weapons and bump the difficulty up (I'm actually pretty good at Suicidal difficulty now ;). Want to just take it easy? Lower the difficulty and put on some relaxing music.\n\nThe game actually comes with a decent selection of music from a range of genres, which I discovered while unlocking the Music Tour achievement. Of course it has a fair bit of electronic music, which you would expect from a game like this, but I very happy to see it actually has some decent alternative rock & metal tracks as well. It can also stream music from a number of Internet radio stations (no idea if it's possible to add more), but of course you will really want to bring your own music collection to enjoy this game the most. For me, that's European style Symphonic Power Metal \\m/\n\nThe perks can be a bit of a grind to unlock, and even more so to fully upgrade them. Unlocking them just takes score, but upgrading them can only be done by picking up in game money - and that only drops $10 at a time. That's not really a problem as the low-mid levels are fairly cheap and is all you need as long as you aren't trying to play on Suicidal difficulty, but maxing them out does take a fair while.\n\nLet's talk weapons. Like most asteroids type games you have a generic laser that can be upgraded by picking up POWer ups. This one is actually pretty good - it has a decent spread and can take out a large number of enemies pretty quickly. The unique thing about this game is the intensity of your weapons also depends on the intensity of the music - picking up VOL+ powerups increases the volume, making your weapons more powerful, but at the same time it also spawns more enemies and makes them faster.\n\nYour second weapon is of course some kind of super bomb, also known as the \"OH GOD TOO MANY ENEMIES!!!\" panic button to take out most of the nearby enemies and give you a few seconds of invaulnerability. Then you have the reflective shield, homing micro missiles and the Ultra Beam to quickly eradicate a large group of enemies in a given direction. I love that none of these weapons feel like duplicates and they all have their place - knowing which one to use when becomes very important in the higher difficulties.\n\nYou remember back in the nineties how games used to have warnings on the box & the first page of the manual not to play them if you suffer from epilepsy? Well, I do. Anyway - I think this game actually means it, it uses a lot of very intense strobing visuals which (other than causing epilectic siezures) can make it pretty hard to see incoming projectiles - when I first started playing half the time I couldn't see what had killed me. The visuals can be toned down (or increased to epic proportions!!!), but personally I kept them on 100% and just got used to them.\n\nIf you are going to buy this, get the Beat Hazard Ultra DLC - some of the stuff I mentioned here is specific to that DLC and the base game does not have a huge amount of variety in terms of enemies, weapons, etc. The only reason not to get the Ultra DLC is to try it out a bit and see if you like it. As soon as you are convinced, buy the Ultra DLC.\n\nI've been playing this on and off over the last two years.

I grew up on a healthy diet of asteroids as a kid as well as G Darius/R-Type/etc. Vertical and Horizontal shooters are my thing. This game doesn't dissapoint. \n\nEven though I haven't played it for close to a year and only dabbled with the ultra version for a week or two, I will say there is a lot of content to keep you coming back. The main appeal is that the levels and enemy frequent/type/etc are all generated by your music. This means infinite replayability, plus it's just a blast to play. \n\nI liken this game more to a 360 degree bullet hell more than a shoot em up. The difficulties are nice and balanced. If you want a challenge, you will find one on the hardest difficulty at the largest intensity you can crank the game up to. \n\nAll in all, you will get your money's worth if you like shoot em ups/bullet hells.

Your scores can be posted and compared, and while I think it is rather silly that turning down the visual intensity in the options has the potential of lowering the score you receive....unless you are a hardcore competitive type, then I doubt this will be much of a concern to you.\n\nYou can snag score multiplier pickups and bombs to help clear the screen in tight spots, and weapon powerups as well so you can increase the potency and versatility of your shots.\n\nOn longer songs big \"boss\" ships arrive and start blasting lasers all over the place, and they can be a handful sometimes, especially if there are still a lot of the smaller cannon fodder chasing you around and limiting your manueverability, but that's all part of the fun.\n\nI would recommend this game more readily were it not for the intensity of the visuals, as-is I can recommend it with some reservation. It is fun, yes, but visually demanding because of all the intensity of the flashes and strobe effects.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1385497277, "timestamp_updated": 1385497277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "5057838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044616187", "num_games_owned": 728, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2368, "last_played": 1423425305}, "language": "english", "review": "Not much to say about a shoot 'em up, huh ?

While gameplay isn't very deep (earn money to unlock new perks, no real campaign), the unique perk system adds some variation to the game[lay style. You have limited number of perks you can activate, resulting in loadouts that are designed to achieve high scores that sacrifice staying power, or heavy-hitting ones to get your through the harder difficulties without getting as high of a score.\n\nUsing your own personal music library with varying difficulty levels gives this game almost endless replay value. Different genres of music will affect how powerful your weapons are, making slow moving, quiet songs relaxing and amping up the pressure during fast, action-packed heavy metal or dubstep. \n\nThe only real issues I have with this game are the inability to redefine X-box controller keys (which are somehow different on Mac and Windows) and manually entering some custom settings in a text file in a certain location. Granted, some of those settings can purposefully reset your scores if you want, but some (like ConstVolume or ThanksButNoThanks) seem like they should be accessible through the in-game options menu. \n\nOverall, this is a really fun game. It looks really amazing when playing in the dark and having your room light up like a rave, and online multi-player makes competition fun as well.

I barely know where to start.\n\nAs a gamer, this is probably my new favorite way to enjoy my music. The gist of this one is that you can select your own music files to \"play\", which adds personality and variety to your game. It works like so: You choose a directory where you keep your music, and you can select any and all music on your computer to play with. Once you select a track, the game loads up and you're in. It should be noted that the visual effects are seizure-inducing (the game warns you this when it starts up), but this is not a problem for most people. I got past it after my first couple of games.\n\nPlaying a certain music file is like playing a different \"level\", albeit with very similar enemies. Most of the time you will fight a \"boss\" ship towards the end of the level that will have a large amount of health and some very dangerous weapons. During the fight, small enemy ships may attack you as well. The best way to deal with the boss is to try and outmaneuver its weapons while keeping it under your concentrated fire.\n\nIt is kind of a difficult game, and it resembles a generic arcade shooter. You have a small ship with a decent amount of firepower and a set number of lives to begin with. Taking a single hit will cause you to lose a life and most of your powerups, but some of the lost powerups drop in the middle of the screen in a cluster and you will have a few brief moments of invulnerability, allowing you to pick them up when you respawn. Power and Volume are your best friends in this game; they increase the amount of guns you can have going at a time, and the intensity of the damage you deal out, respectively. \n\nYou will notice that the visual effects as well as your damage increase quite a bit when heavy bass or loud, sharp tones play in your music. This makes it ideal for dubstep and metal in my opinion, but as long as your music has a sick beat and a high enough volume, you should be fine. The visuals can be distracting at times, such as when your music becomes more intense and everything gets two or three times brighter. This makes it harder to see what your enemies are doing, but picking up on certain visual cues will help. One such cue is that one of the main indestructible projectiles that is fired at your ship is always red in color, and is always round.\n\nEven if you don't want to play the game, you can use the game's built-in visualizer in \"Chill Out\" mode to just listen to music and watch your screen do its thing.

Remember Apple's and Microsoft\u2019s visualizer or maybe you're one of those people that still put that on. What IF you wanted to play a game in that cluster f***? Well you can!\n\nControls (I personally like the keyboard and mouse so I mostly know them) are smooth and responsive as hell, the keyboard controls the ship and abilities, the mouse fires and also uses abilities; they're fully bindable. The controller plays just as you expect, one control stick controls the ship and the other fires in the direction, the abilities are used with the triggers (I think).\n\nThe gameplay is well... you\u2019re put in an arena; you listen to your music AND YOU SHOOT EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE UNTIL YOU GO BLIND or YOU DIE. Sounds simple enough, well it's just that honestly. Depending upon the song this can be easy as hell or so hard you just wanna kill someone! The online is a bit weak due to \"you must have the same copy of the song\" due to piracy; co-op isn't bad; I only really played an hour on co-op.\n\nWhile the game is fun and awesome there are some things that just fall flat on its face. The fact that Ultra is DLC; this isn\u2019t a bad thing but compared to the original the Ultra DLC offers WAY more in content and gameplay, I\u2019m not saying the original isn\u2019t fun but it comes across kind of lame in comparison\u2026 at least for me, there are quite a bit of people who just like the original more. Once you beat the game, level to the highest level and get all of the achievements it offers very little to come back to. Some bullets are VERY hard to see considering what it is and that\u2019s the point but sometimes you\u2019ll be wondering what just killed you!? The games difficulty is great and all but it also leads to certain songs being balls hard while some easy as hell.\n\nThis game is one of my favorite music based games and it\u2019s completely fun but it offers no reliability or even an incentive to even come back to, some may find that not such a big deal considering the price of the game but once you\u2019re done\u2026 you\u2019re actually done\u2026 of course there is a leaderboard so\u2026 there\u2019s that I guess. The visuals are great but can lead to mystery deaths. Songs can be way too hard or way too easy, sometimes you can\u2019t find a middle ground. Is the game worth it? Yes, but I love music and at times play games with my music. This game really depends if you can stand a lot of visuals, love music.\n\n(My first review)", "timestamp_created": 1310069149, "timestamp_updated": 1392666328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "9142602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014519303", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1015, "last_played": 1712960373}, "language": "english", "review": "The feeling of instant adrenalin pumping to the track of your favorite tracks. \n\nEnjoy your Metal with a slice of space-juice \\m/", "timestamp_created": 1392573108, "timestamp_updated": 1392573108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "9133840", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970933804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1394328185}, "language": "english", "review": "A new way to enjoy your music asteroid style!", "timestamp_created": 1392530187, "timestamp_updated": 1392530187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "9115529", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984966545", "num_games_owned": 885, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2013, "last_played": 1670045807}, "language": "english", "review": "Beat Hazard can be described as Audiosurf meets Asteroids on something highly illegal.\n\n[b]DO NOT PLAY IN THE DARK![/b] The flashing lights of the game will give you a headache if you don't have good lighting in the room in the best case, and a seizure in the worst.\n\nThat aside, it's a lot of fun and a good way to get more use out of your music library.

The single worst thing that enflames that aspect though, is the volume power-ups. So, even if you start out with something huge and blasting, well, too bad. It's going to play it softly until you collect the power-ups to make it louder so that you can actually hear the music that you put on.

Completely breaks the immersive experience, and so the game just comes along as feeling cheap and gimmicky. Especially since, without the music hook, there's nothing that makes the game stand out.

There have been many times where I've died early in a level, and ended up better off for it because of the drops (I've even had my score multiplier increase after dying).\n- The levels are randomly generated, even with the same song, so high scores per song are basically meaningless.\n- As far as I can tell, the only way the game 'reacts' to your music is by slowing down the enemies and your fire-rate (and weakening your weapons it seems) during slow or quiet parts of songs.  A major downside of this, is that for songs that are slow and/or quiet by nature, it is nearly impossible to kill anything because your bullets are so weak and shoot so slowly.\n- A side note, if you don't like games with excessively bright and flashing lights, do NOT buy this game.  I have the visual intensity set to 25% and it is still a seizure on the screen.\n\nAll that said, if you want an arcade shooter whose soundtrack is your own music library, then this is the game for you.  Although you'd be better off buying a real bullet-hell game, muting the game's music, and playing your own.

But going deeper in this game, it is actually a very fun ship shooter experience. The usage of music is nice by using changes in intensity, which the game encourages by putting Volume powerups to increase the music volume. The enemy types are varied well, from asteroids to dummy ships to more interesting tentacles and gunships. Each enemy is weak or very powerful and able to deal massive damage. The music not only afffects weapon powerups but subtly the light intensity and enemy speed. This game's built in collection of music is a more hardcore experience best suited for the gameplay, but using your own music is also in itself very fun.

I didnt have high expectations, and it seriously hit me with a surprise. See, when you turn Beat Hazard on to play a game of it, you shoudn't expect highly complex gameplay, or intense story. In fact it doesn't even have a story, you are controlling a spaceship, and you have to shoot asteroids and other spaceships from a top view perspective, just like the old arcade games. What makes Beat Hazard special is, all of this is happening to music. Your chosen music.\n\nWhen you start up Beat Hazard, the thing you should expect is crazyness. You shouldn't search sense, just shoot and enjoy the music that you chose for your shooting. The visualizer really gives you that \"crazyness\" feeling, and the rate of the incoming enemies is also somewhat related to the tempo of your music. \n\nI mean... This game has a powerup that literally just pumps your music volume up... What do you expect then?\n\nAnd I recommend playing with maximum intensity visualizer for extreme \"crazyness\". Of course if you are sensitive for that kind of thing, be careful.\n\nOverall:\nPros:\n-FUN AS HELL\n-works quite well as a rhythm game (kinda)\n-really nice visualizer\n-more fun\n\nCons:\n-it can easily get repetitive after a while\n-without the DLCs, it's basically an overpriced demo\n\nDefinitely recommend picking it up at least on a steam sale, but be sure to get the DLCs too.", "timestamp_created": 1472220294, "timestamp_updated": 1472220294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519313335418701172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "25157881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029237691", "num_games_owned": 842, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1482955775}, "language": "english", "review": "Music synchronized games are always really fun.

Do be weary of staying on the sides, as just with the orignal game it is spawned out of, enemies will pop out of the other side in which you cannot even do. The difficulty is also controlled by the tempo of each of the instruments and keeping to such the enemies, your rate of fire, thier rate of fire is all controlled by that so hold on to the seat of your pants and find the highest bpm music you can find. The electronica genre is very good for this type of adaptive difficulty.\n\n\nHowever, there are a few minor flaws, just like almost every other game in its genre since the SNES days, and that is once things get crowded enough you cannot even see the bullets that are being hid behind all the strobing light effects, explosions, and everything else flying around the screen.

It\u2019s possible most of this review will only be relevant to Beat Hazard Ultra.\nAlso, if you have a history of epilepsy/seizures or anything related, pass on this game. Seriously.\n\nBeat Hazard is an extremely visually intensive shoot em\u2019 up music game. You pick a mode, pick a song, either your own or from the supplied ones in the game, and then you play it. Enemy ships spawn, with some accordance to the intensity of the song. You shoot them with your incredibly flashy weapons. If listening to your music and shooting enemy spaceships while lights flash a ton sounds appealing to you, then great. This might be your game. There\u2019s also controller support! (I recommend controller if you can. It\u2019s very nice.)\n\nThere are a pretty decent amount of options when you play a song. You have three initial difficulties, Easy, Normal, Hardcore, and you can unlock Insane and Suicidal later on. Visual Intensity can be set to 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, and 200%. (These do affect score, but honestly 200% is very difficult to look at, with only a 20% bonus.) Finally, there are perks. And there are a lot of perks. Score boosting perks, item perks, and sub weapon perks. \n\nThe four game modes are\u2026\nStandard: Playing through one song\nSurvival: Playing for a long as you can while the game cycles through songs\nBoss Rush: Fighting bosses on a timer before more spawn, as long as you can, while songs cycle\nChill Out: All perks unlocked, infinite sub weapons, infinite lives, no score, no currency earning, casual playing\n\nThe Shadow Operations Unit DLC is an alright buy. You gain access to more ships, including Steam Workshop ones, and you can make your own as well. Each ship plays differently, and it\u2019s a nice change of pace. However, I will say the Shadow Missions are incredibly\u2026 irksome. Death penalties can be difficult to overcome depending on the mission, and some missions are just difficult to begin with. You can absolutely opt out of the missions, since they\u2019re just there for achievements.\n\nA few people call it a rhythm game, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, rhythm games are defined by a strong correlation of the song with the gameplay. For example, in Crypt of the Necrodancer, your movement is meant to be linked with the beat of the song. Beat Hazard isn\u2019t really like that. The closest you\u2019ll get is if the song intensity dips down into nothing, and then comes back up. It\u2019s not really related to the beat.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

Beat Hazard lets you select your own music and then uses the tempo to create difficulty spikes and flow of enemies. The beat of the song is scene in the bullets you shoot as well as the crazy explosions one screen that can give you a seizure. When you select your music you get to decide the difficulty. Pick a heavy and fast metal song and you\u2019ll be lucky if you get through the whole thing. Pick a normal soft rock song and the difficulty is very gradual.\n\nWhen you actually start shooting there are several power-ups that range from increasing the volume, shot power, money, and bombs. If you die you can collect the stuff your dropped, but if you keep collecting the stuff you get more and more powerful. You can use the money to buy perks that range from power-ups when you start, extra lives, and other various perks. There\u2019s a good amount and it\u2019s worth playing just to unlock them all. However, the game doesn\u2019t have much depth so this is a 30 minutes-at-a-time game or you will get bored. The visuals are decent, but the special effects that flash around remind me of Geometry Wars on crack.\n\nSo this is once again a game that makes you the decider of how fun of an experience you get. The engine underneath does a good job using the songs to great a fun space shooter, but I would liked to have seen more power-ups or maybe something more 3D. If you don\u2019t like 2D space shooters you won\u2019t like this even if you get to use your own music. The game can get really hard quick and can be a bit confusing at first until you get the hang of it. There are quite a few modes such as multiplayer, boss rush, and endless mode so there is some variety there.

It\u2019s really pretty, but it\u2019s also a very visually loud game, and I can imagine you would need to be in the right kind of mood to properly get into this game. If you suffer from epilepsy, perhaps avoid this one.\n\nWhat makes this game a little more interesting than your standard bullet hell type game though, is that you can level up, unlock new perks and customise your ship. From what I can tell, you are rewarded for playing this game, which isn\u2019t always too common in the music driven genre.\n\nThe most attractive feature, however, seems to be the difficulty aspect of this game. Like those guitar hero videos you see on super mega extreme difficulty, you can really get this game to be crazy if you pick the highest difficulty mode, and choose a really challenging song. \n\nIt may seem a little weird that I\u2019m writing a review for a game that I have barely played, it kind of is, for me this game is a little too loud and flashy, but I can definitely see why this game was so popular. Despite me not having spent any real time in it, I still want to recommend it as a decent music driven game. As far as the genre goes, there are a fair few of the same. There is a lot of runners/on track games, and at least this one is a bit different.\n\nThere is now since a Beat Hazard 2 out, which I don\u2019t own yet but can imagine that it\u2019s worth looking at too.\n\nAll in all, I shouldn\u2019t really have much of an opinion, but I do. Despite not being 100% my cup of tea, it\u2019s a decent game, it\u2019s well made and it\u2019s something a bit different in the music driven genre. I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth a go, so perhaps give this a try, or even just look into buying the second one.\n\n\nTL;DR : Basically it\u2019s pretty loud and flashy for me, I\u2019m an old lady, it gives me a headache. At least it is something a bit different in the music driven genre, it\u2019s well made, and I can see why it was so popular. Give it a go if you want a music driven version of asteroids, or even look at the second one. \n\n[quote][b]Controller support:[/b] Included\n[b]Local music files:[/b] Included\n[b]Online streaming:[/b] Not included[/quote]\n[quote]For more reviews of this genre, check out my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/29402802-The-Best-Music-Driven-Games-%25E2%2599%25AB/] The Best: Music Driven Games \u266b[/url]\nWhere we review games able to be driven by your own music.

The screen shots on the store page made it seem so noisy and cluttered that I was worried I wouldn't be able to parse anything happening.  I am very happy I ended up purchasing the game despite my fears.  It is a lovely way to experience music.  \n\nThe combat is hectic enough to be challenging, but mindless enough to be relaxing.  There's a satisfying sense of progression as one ranks up and earns upgrades.  The player has the option of choosing from a range of different difficulty and visual settings depending on how intense they want their experience to be.  The ships all felt unique and helped to vary the gameplay as well as provide new sets of challenges in order to rank up.  \n\nGetting all the achievements took me ~19 hours and I never felt like earning them was a grind, so I think it's priced pretty reasonably.  \n\nI'm not typically a fan of shoot 'em ups, but this was really fun.

The game itself has you piloting a ship (or one of many with DLC) whose goal is to score as many points as necessary within the length of any given song and to avoid dying. You'll face enemies ranging from stray asteroids and basic enemy ships, to mines and even bosses in the form of large monsters or battleships with a multitude of weapons at their disposal.\n\n The game rewards you for staying alive by supplying you random powerups and score multipliers that dropped from defeated enemies. If you die, which you can by being hit just once, you lose some  of your powers and score bonuses. At the end of the song, your score is tallied and as you score more points, your piloting rank will increase. Increasing your rank gives you the option to select bonus perks, weapons or even extra lives based on your play style.\n\nThe difficulty can be adjusted based on two parameters: The song you play and the base game's difficulty. Since the game's pace is based on your music's pace, speeding up and slowing down as the music does, creating a different play through for each song. You can also ramp up the challenge by selecting \"hardcore\", \"insane\" \"and suicidal\". I found \"hardcore\" to be a nice base for causal playing if you're looking for something that won't stress you out. \"Insane\" is great for a challenge and \"Suicidal\" is, well, suicidal. If you're looking to test your reflexes, it will show you no mercy.\n\n In my eyes, the visuals are what make this game so enjoyable. Even with roughly 40 hours of game play done at the time of this review, the visuals have yet to bore me. The visuals, much like the pace of the game, will fluctuate between slow and erratic, constantly changing colors. Players can adjust how strong they want the color effects from the ingame menu, helpful for those with sensitivity issues or that have a difficult time determining enemies from balls of light in the background.\n\n While your overall enjoyment and replayability may differ, the game is well polished and provides comfortable atmosphere and challenging game play. I've enjoyed every moment of this game.\n\n [u] [h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1] [/u]\n[list]\n[*] Music - The game syncs to your media library, offering you as many songs to play against as you have.\n[*] Track Diversity - The waves of enemies you meet and the pace you meet them changes on each track, keeping you on your toes.\n[*] Visuals - Colorful, bright (sometimes too bright :P) and, frankly, pretty to watch.\n[*]Challenge - The game can offer a constant challenge.\n[/list]\n\n [u] [h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1] [/u]\n[list]\n[*] Without music on your PC, the game would be a shell of its former self.

I cannot sit through these kind of visuals, it's unimaginably bad. Big random particle effects are not fun, they strain the eyes. But when you turn them off, you see the games dull interior. Stock ships and static icons to go around. I tried playing the hardest mode to see if the ships really could be differentiated, but alas, no. Even if the artists of the game make each ship a different color, they would still look the same.\n\n\nThat's on top of the fact that they use the same ships over and over again. There is one scout ship design, but there could be 30 of the things on the screen. It just looks ugly. But when you get to a boss, that's the really kicker. They start to shed hundreds of the same little yellow and red triangle looking thing, until you get to the gross interior of this thing. It makes it even worse by the very black background. Puke green on black, awesome.\n\n\nThe meat of the game comes from it's one gimmick: your music fuels the game. Yeah right, more like background music to boring game play. I put in one of the most techno songs I had, it had a base drop and everything, and the game didn't even follow the beat of the damned song! You put in \"Marry had a little lamb\" and you still wouldn't know how the song and game play correspond. The ships come in at random, and you shoot them. I thought the lasers would of had a beat to follow the song, but no. Nothing of the sort came my way, only disappointment.\n\n\nThis game is nothing but a bunch of static images shoot particle effects. This game should be for like 2 bucks, but it's 10. Plus, it's necessary DLC, Shadow Operations Unit. That. unlocks the steam workshop and missions. It might of done something else, but not as far as I got. The first thing I looked at before even playing the game was a logo that looked like it was made in MS Paint. It was an unskippable text cut scene that felt like 15 minutes.\n\n\nI was genuinely surprised that some of the most basics things to a game were DLC, which made me wonder when the DLC came out. Turns out Shadow Operations Unit came out 4 YEARS after the games initial release. What? It took these smucks 4 years to add missions and a leader board? That's horrible. M4A file support wasn't even available at launch. (just as a side note, there is an option to play the game in classic mode, but I couldn't even get that to work)\n\n\nBut wait! There's more! The game didn't even work for me for the first hour after buying it. It kept crashing, so I had to go find the file, and change it's properties, and then create a different file to put in the roaming folder to make it windows and HOLY CRAP. I should not have to do this much computer work to make a game work properly. Even after that, the game still crashed during game play. I am running win8.1 and even games that ran on XP work, so this is inexcusable.\n\n\nIf you skipped down to the bottom to get my verdict here it is: it's bad, eye straining, and doesn't even work properly.

Music intensity affects the spawn of enemies and your firing rate, slowing to a crawl in silent parts. It's nice to play with your music, but this isn't Audiosurf-style interaction. I know the meme is to play with high visual intensity and abuse yourself, but just turn the visuals down to 50%. I wish there was a lower setting than that, as the visuals just cloud everything. No one cares what setting you use.\n\nNew weapons make tracks more interesting, but the progression system makes the game hardest at the start. I wish there was a difficulty option between Hardcore and Insane, as there is a fair amount of time where you don't have the ship upgrades to reasonably beat long Insane songs, but Hardcore becomes too simple. The Shadow DLC is compelling, adding new ship options and support for auto-fire ships to further increase the variety. However, the DLC does not change the musical interaction, so the gameplay is identical.\n\nIt's easy to pick up and play, and pretty enjoyable. There's good replayability in theory, but I don't think the shooting is varied enough to come back to it regularly after finishing off all the challenges. Audiosurf has more gameplay options to keep things fresh, but this is still an enjoyable shooter with all the DLC.

There are a TON of flashing lights in this game.\n\nI remember a year or so ago that I first heard of it in a video I can't remember what it was about. I decided to get it since I was kinda curious and I liked the idea of gameplay based on music, as I enjoyed audiosurf myself. It kinda just sat there for a while. And with a while I mean over a year. So now I tried it again and played some vidya tunes on it. And I must say, it's quite enjoyable.\n\nTo put it simply, this is a 2D, dare I say arcade-like shooter. But the 'levels' to put it like there are based of the soundtrack you choose, and the more intense the music is, the more things happen on the screen. There's probably also something with the rhythm, but I didn't notice it all that much. But I'm probably missing something. There are different enemies and bosses. Most of them vary from size, projectiles, and movement paths, to put it like that. That's really all I can say for the enemies. Oh right there are bosses as well I suppose.\n\nThere are also perks you can unlock by playing (or that is part of the ultra DLC pack. Which I think it is.), Which are basically bonuses to help you out, or unlock some new stuff.\n\nIn the end. I can recommend this game if you have some money in your steam wallet which you don't know what to spend it on, if it's on sale, or you are just curious. I myself think this is a pretty good game to play if you're bored and want to shoot things while listening to any song from Metal Gear Rising or any Pursuit theme from Ace Attorney.

It's a top-down dual-stick shooter that seems to take inspiration from Asteroid and others.\n\nEach song is it's own level, and you can use mp3 songs, ITunes songs, not sure what other formats though aside from those.\n\nYou want more levels? You get more songs and you play them. In addition to this, the DLC allows you to access more ships which play differently (essentially allowing for an entirely different playstyle with certain ones) and gives challenges to aim for, and the other DLC adds in 100% more stuff. Imagine with this last DLC, that you took beat Hazard and added one new thing for every old one.\n\nSo Beat Hazard's DLC is entirely worth it in my opinion.\n\nThere are powerups, Damage and Volume. One makes you do more damage, and the other increases the song's volume which gives you many benefits alongside more projectiles and more damage aswell. Max them both out, and you go into Beat Hazard mode, which makes the game WAY easier to kill things.\n\nYou die in one hit, so it is VERY challenging as some challenges require to never die in a song on high difficulties.\n\nYou gain Exp in the amount of Points you gain (you get 1000 points on a song, you get 1000 Exp) and there are ranks/levels, but only Shadow Operations ranks really dictate what you have access to.\nRanks do dictate the giving of perk points however.\nThere's Elite ranks that go on for forever, they're more for bragging rights more than anything.\n\nYou can put together playlists of songs in the game you can listen to randomized shuffles of your library that go on and on until you die, or you can even listen to a radio station until you die, like the christmas radio station, which provides challenge greater than all my Dragonforce and Metallica songs (I have about 19 metallica, and 6 dragonforce songs).\n\nOnly special abilities and enemy attacks use sounds, but nothing really is every louder than the music, unless you set it accordingly.\n\nSo... I recommend this game, it's great fun for it's price, the DLC is priced very well in my opinion, and so long as there's always music, there's always levels for this game, so content is potentially unlimited. Basically an interactive music player, blast enemies as you listen to your tunes.\n\nI give this game a 9/10, ignoring the fact that I have no friends who want to play this game. This game is simply great. Challenging or easy when you want either.

Being a game based off of music you really need to enjoy listening to music to play it. The music is pulled form your computer (itunes usage is available through a cheap dlc) and there is some pre loaded music that the game comes with. So if you have no music on your computer you'll either have to use the internet radios it gives you, download some music, or just use the couple of songs the game provides. The Shadow Operations Unit dlc does add extra ships to the game each with advantages and disadvantages of their own, but it is not neccessary to fully enjoy the game. The Beat Hazard Ultra is not absolutely needed to play the game and enjoy it but I highly recomend buying it if you can, even better buy the bundle and get all the dlc for the game and get the full experience. The only downside to the game is that by default settings the SFX sound is turned up rather high and the sounds of the game tend to become to much for me to enjoy the music and lightshow it provides, this is simply fixed however by turning it down to a lower level and the SFX are hardly noticable anymore.

With that being said, this nice little game is a great way to listen new songs, favorites, backlogs and whatnot all while engaging in some frantic and/or cozy shoot em up experience (depending on the difficulty setting of course). Not just that, the many game modes (i.e. multiplayer, boss rush, survival) will drastically increase what already has the potential to be well over hundreds of hours of enjoyment. I also loved how you can buy new ships, perks and upgrades in-game, even though veterans don't need all of that. For them, I'll simply suggest to embrace the idea of a shmup fueled with your own music; which can be both nostalgic and modern at the same time. While for newbies, and even those who don't like the genre, give it a chance.

I have played it many, many hours because its modest price doesn't reflect how good it is. Lots of games and electronic toys interact with your music collection in some gimmicky way, but Beat Hazard really interacts in a recognizable way that is a cut above cheap toys and cheesy games. The levels and enemies spawned by your music collection will provide hours of enjoyable and challenging game play.\n\nThe Steam version is a remarkable improvement on the classic version,adding support for a variety of audio formats that were unavailable when this game was released on a disc 10yrs ago.

It\u2019s like a disco for trigger-happy maniacs like me!\n\n(On the screen, spaceships and asteroids start moving to the beat of a catchy tune.)\n\nSam: (looking at the screen) Well, I\u2019ll be darned.

Memorizing the various boss patterns & strategies, learning when to use your super weapons & bombs, it all provides a great deal of content.  The stages are partially based of the music selected, with things like weapon power & enemy variety dependent on the song.  As such, each song can provide a different experience.  The preset songs can be a bit of fun as well.  The controls are very smooth, allowing fluent movement & easy take downs of the simpler ships, yet allows the player to dodge around larger targets.  Another positive is how each different attack makes a different sound, allowing the player to be clued in on what attack is coming, & how to best deal with it.\n\n[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] Geez, this game has a lot of flashing lights.  The epilepsy warning at the beginning is no joke, & for those who are sensitive to that, it can ruin your day after only a few matches.  Other than that, some of the songs can be a little tedious if they either spawn too few power ups, or too few enemies, making long form play that bounces from one song to another a gamble.  That last one really is more on the player's end than the game's, however.  Lastly, the Shadow Missions DLC is a little lackluster, with the real meat coming from the extra enemies & bosses it provides.\n\n[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]:[/b] This one can be a bit of a challenge, depending on reflexes, & previous knowledge with space shooters.  But once you begin leveling up your perks, a lot becomes a great deal easier.  Playing around with a few songs that you know will drop what you need is also a massive help.\n\n[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] Asteroids meets your music library is a wonderful match, & if you tone down some of the particle effects, it's even better.  The game has a few flaws that do take away from the core experience, but it still holds itself up on it's positive traits, moving from strength to strength to create a fun & dynamic experience on your way up the perk list.", "timestamp_created": 1586912115, "timestamp_updated": 1685762134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "139374582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071839052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1710702039}, "language": "english", "review": "really fun and very unique rhythm game and it still hold up very well for how old it is", "timestamp_created": 1685631475, "timestamp_updated": 1685631475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "1602221", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995259232", "num_games_owned": 4171, "num_reviews": 377, "playtime_forever": 1418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1418, "last_played": 1371442256}, "language": "english", "review": "Still the best in this series.", "timestamp_created": 1310526211, "timestamp_updated": 1684359553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "137950462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007343154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 462, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 759, "last_played": 1374584599}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.

This is a pretty good little game. This is a music-controlled, twin-stick shooter space arcade game. The Intensity of the music track being played controls the speed at which enemies move, the rate at which your main weapon fires and the number of enemies which appear at a time. However, beyond the bright, flickering special effects and music-controlled enemy behavior, Beat Hazard actually plays a lot like the classic Atari Asteroids game (except with more enemy variety, far better controls and far better weapons).\n\n+ This game is capable of playing any mp3 file on your computer and using that file to (at least partially) control in-game enemy behavior. This means that Beat Hazard has as many levels as you have mp3 files to play. Even better, (especially if you get the DLC content) this game features several ship types, several game modes and multiple difficulty levels. There are also several enemy types. The replay value of this arcade-style game is quite high as a result despite the fact that this game lacks any plot.\n\n+/- The controls are highly responsive and there are no major bugs though the game\u2019s method for binding controls is a bit tricky. Keys must be held down at the prompted times in order to bind those keys (not just tapped).\n\n+/- A lot of this game\u2019s challenge is coping with how busy and confused the game\u2019s graphics can get. The amount of special effects and visual glare occurring on-screen is controlled by the intensity and tempo of the music being played at any given time. The more intense the music, the more busy the game\u2019s visuals will be (even if the effect intensity is turned down to 50%, the game\u2019s minimum setting). Quiet, peaceful songs are a lot easier to play through than busy, frenetic songs.\n\n+/- DLC content is excellent and adds much needed features such as special missions to unlock different, interesting ships and large boss enemies which appear during songs. While this content is all very good, it is also all stuff that probably should have been in the base game to begin with. The bosses occasionally show up at odd times during songs (not necessarily the song\u2019s climax) unfortunately. \n\n- The bright, glaring, strobing and flickering graphical effects can quickly become irritating. Beyond the music controlling the enemies\u2019 number and movements, this becomes a game about not accidentally bumping into stuff as it becomes increasingly difficult to see what you are doing due to all the flickering flashes on screen.\n\n- Once the novelty of the game\u2019s central idea wears off and you get a general idea for how the game reacts to different types of music, Beat Hazard can begin to feel repetitive and eventually, stale. Using multiplayer options can decrease this feeling for a while. \n\nEven so, if you REALLY like listening to music like I do, Beat Hazard can be a fun little game to use while you listen to your songs if the busy, flashing graphics aren\u2019t too much of a distraction. I\u2019d recommend getting Beat Hazard for cheap during a steam sale and given this game\u2019s age, finding it for cheap shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.", "timestamp_created": 1434938961, "timestamp_updated": 1673596175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "116728200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198999733467", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1712433858}, "language": "english", "review": "Confirmed game for epileptics", "timestamp_created": 1654791785, "timestamp_updated": 1673443370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562366187572479248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}]
