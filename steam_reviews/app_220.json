I may have said Not Recommended, but I mean that I don't like it. Here is why.\r\n\r\n1. Puzzles. I don't like puzzle games, even Portal. I think it drags them out too much. \r\n2. Length. It's a super long game and I'm not much of a fan of long games.\r\n3. Complicated. So many weapons (I understand a lot of people like that, such as DOOM fans) and there are a lot of enemies. A lot of things to keep track of. \r\n4. I'm pretty bad at games. Call me a game journalist if you must, but I really suck at games and that rage I get from failing may be why I don't like it. \r\n5. Boring. A lot of waiting must be done. I don't mind waiting for the speeches though, I like that part. Most of the game is really slow, as well.\r\n6. Community. A lot of (not most, just a lot of people) the community of the Half-Life games have kind of left me desensitized. \r\n7. Not fun for achievement hunters. I am one, and there are a lot of achievements, a lot super hard. It doesn't feel good when it's easy to miss. \r\n\r\nBut there are some things I like. Here are a few.\r\n1. Lore. Goddamn, the lore. The history, the events, the Combine, it's so amazing.\r\n2. Characters. Alyx, Barney, Kleiner, Lamarr, Grigori, the like. I love the characters, and the dialog is one of the best parts. I don't mind waiting through speech.\r\n3. Community (again). Some of the community is actually wholesome, and those willing to guide me through the game were a great help.\r\n4. Buildup/plot. I won't spoil the plot. The plot is so fantastic, going from one place to another. Yes, sometimes dragged out, but still fun to go through. \r\n5. Speedrunning. Simply put, super fun to reverse-bhop, find routes, go fast.

They're experiences.  The games are the pinnacle of first person shooting, level design and character ego. You once again reprise the role of Gordon Freeman, a physicist who finds himself in the middle of an interstellar occupation on Earth by a race known as the Combine. They have brutally conquered Earth, subjugated mankind and are in the process of stripping the planet of its natural resources.  There is no hope until you show up, fresh out of limbo which you were slipped into by the elusive GMAN. He resurrects you and sends you to work against the Combine as if you- just little old you- can make the difference.   Ironically, you can!  Gordon will single handedly gun down waves of Combine footsoldiers, elite units and HG Wells styled Tripods with laser beams and warp cannons using conventional weapons and a will to keep moving forward!\r\n\r\nI initially played this game on the original XBOX.  Hardware has changed considerably over the past 20 years.  Looking back, it's amazing Xbox was able to run this game, but it did so with massive framerate drops when the action heated up.  Now, in 2025, We have CPU, RAM, SSD drives and GPU more than 100 times as fast as that hardware. The game runs buttery smooth in the highest resolutions.\r\n\r\nHalf Life and Half Life 2 are both experiences.  A large portion of the game is spent gunning down heavily armed soldiers, but an equal amount of time is spent traversing the levels which feel connected to each other rather than independent of each other.  Unfortunately, a large amount of that time is also spent solving puzzles.  Physics puzzles.  You'll need to move boxes, pipes and other levers to access new locations. The first playthrough - it's OK.  The following playthroughs, it's simply annoying and slows down the pacing.   The gun battles with the Combine soldiers are roughly as good as they were with the Marine special ops in the original game. The difference is that their weapons are more powerful and they don't work as hard to flank you.  The reality is, they're at an extreme disadvantage because your HEV suit acts as battle armor and it's far more resilient to their weapons than they are. \r\n\r\nThis game is very good, and I wish for a sequel, but the developers haven't given us Half Life 3 nor do they seem to have any finalized plans as to whether or not they'll do so. They did give us expansions to Half Life 2, but there is no solid conclusion to the war yet.

The guy has seen it all\u2014aliens, dystopian oppression, and enough explosions to make Michael Bay blush, and yet he utters not a single word. You\u2019re a one-man army armed with science and silence, moving through a world that\u2019s constantly on the edge of collapse.\nHere\u2019s the thing about Half-Life 2: you\u2019re not really sure what\u2019s going on half the time, and neither is Gordon. One minute you\u2019re waking up from a multi-year nap, the next you\u2019re being hunted by an alien regime called the Combine, all while a creepy suit-wearing dude (G-Man) keeps popping up, staring at you like he\u2019s your weird uncle at a family gathering.\n\nHalf-Life 2 might look like a game about shooting aliens, but it\u2019s really a lesson in physics. The Gravity Gun, the most overpowered science project since the Mentos-and-Coke experiment. With this bad boy, you can pick up nearly anything, barrels, boxes, saw blades, you name it, and launch it at your enemies with extreme prejudice. Why bother shooting when you can fling entire washing machines at foes?\n\nCity 17 is where Half-Life 2 is set, and if you\u2019re into totalitarian regimes and grimy aesthetics, you\u2019ll love it! The whole place feels like someone looked at Eastern European architecture and said, \u201cLet\u2019s make this more depressing.\u201d The Combine patrol the city with zero chill, and their idea of a good time is chasing you down with stun batons, barking incomprehensible orders in a robotic voice. The city is both beautiful and terrifying, with crumbling buildings, abandoned railways, and the occasional glimpse of a giant alien tripod creature stomping around like it owns the place. \n\nIf City 17 is depressing, Ravenholm is that extra dose of nightmare fuel you didn\u2019t ask for, even the game itself warns you \u201cWe don\u2019t go to Ravenholm.\u201d It\u2019s basically a haunted house with killer traps, headcrab zombies, and the overall aesthetic of a place you wouldn\u2019t visit even if someone paid you. The vibe here? Spooky as hell, with just enough Silent Hill energy to make you question why you ever left the train in the first place.\n\nThe Half-Life 2 community is one of the most dedicated and passionate groups in gaming history. They\u2019ve kept the game alive through mods, memes, and theories, all while maintaining a sense of humor about the fact that Valve has left them hanging for over a decade. HL2 isn\u2019t just a game; it\u2019s a cultural phenomenon, a collective nostalgia trip, and, perhaps most importantly, an ongoing inside joke that only gets funnier with time.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a game that transcends its time.

A masterpiece that redefined the gaming industry with its unparalleled storytelling, groundbreaking physics engine, and unforgettable atmosphere. Even in 2025, it remains one of the most immersive and technically impressive experiences ever crafted.\n\n[h2]A Legacy That Shook the Industry:[/h2]\nWhen Half-Life 2 was released in 2004, it sent shockwaves through the gaming world. Valve introduced Havok Physics, allowing realistic object interaction that was unheard of at the time. From using the Gravity Gun to launch barrels at enemies to solving physics-based puzzles, the game was way ahead of its time. Even today, many modern FPS games fail to match its level of interaction.\n\n[h2]A Timeless Story in a Dystopian World:[/h2]\nHalf-Life 2 picks up years after the Black Mesa Incident from the first game. The world has fallen under the control of the Combine, an oppressive alien force that governs Earth with an iron fist. As Gordon Freeman, the silent yet iconic protagonist, players join the resistance, fighting for the survival of humanity.\n\nThe story unfolds in a cinematic yet seamless manner, without cutscenes breaking the immersion. Each chapter introduces new gameplay elements, locations, and enemies, making every moment feel fresh. From the eerie streets of City 17 to the desolate landscapes of Highway 17, every area is filled with environmental storytelling that deepens the world\u2019s lore.\n\n[h2]Characters That Feel Alive:[/h2]\nValve\u2019s facial animation technology was revolutionary for its time, making characters incredibly expressive. Iconic figures like:\n\n[b]Alyx Vance[/b] \u2013 A brilliantly written companion with realistic AI and deep emotional weight.\n\n[b]Dr. Kleiner & Dr. Eli Vance[/b] \u2013 Scientists who guide Gordon and bring humor and warmth.\n\n[b]Barney Calhoun[/b] \u2013 A resistance fighter and an old friend from Black Mesa.\n\n[b]G-Man[/b] \u2013 The enigmatic figure who pulls the strings behind the scenes, shrouded in mystery.\n\nEach character has memorable dialogues and interactions, making the world feel alive.\n\n[h2]A Masterpiece in Game Design:[/h2]\nEvery level in Half-Life 2 is a work of art. The game never holds your hand, yet its level design naturally guides you toward objectives. From navigating zombie-infested Ravenholm to leading the resistance in City 17, every chapter is unique and unforgettable.\n\nThe atmosphere is second to none. The blend of gritty realism and sci-fi dystopia creates a setting that is both immersive and hauntingly believable.\n\n[h2]RTX Update \u2013 A New Era for Half-Life 2:[/h2]\nA fully ray-traced version of Half-Life 2 is on the horizon, bringing:\n\u2705 [b]Advanced lighting & reflections[/b]\n\u2705 [b]Enhanced textures & models[/b]\n\u2705 [b]Even more realistic physics interactions[/b]\n\nWith this update, Half-Life 2 will once again set the standard for gaming visuals. It\u2019s incredible to think that a game from 2004 is about to look better than most modern titles!\n\n[h2]Final Verdict:[/h2]\nHalf-Life 2 is not just a game; it\u2019s an artistic and technical milestone that continues to inspire generations of developers. If you\u2019ve never played it, you\u2019re missing out on one of the greatest gaming experiences of all time. With the RTX update coming soon, now is the perfect time to (re)experience this legendary masterpiece.\n\n[h2][b]\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (10/10) - Masterpiece

(5/5)\r\n\r\nReview:\r\n\r\nHalf-Life 2 is one of those rare games that lives up to all the hype and even exceeds expectations. It\u2019s been over a decade since its release, but it still holds up as one of the best first-person shooters ever made.\r\n\r\nThe game picks up where the first one left off, with Gordon Freeman now in a dystopian world controlled by an alien race known as the Combine. The story is told in such a seamless, immersive way\u2014there are no cutscenes, just you moving through the world and piecing things together as you go. It\u2019s one of the best examples of world-building in a game.\r\n\r\nThe physics engine is a game-changer. The way you can manipulate objects in the environment with the iconic gravity gun adds so much fun to the combat and puzzle-solving. It's one of those simple ideas that feels revolutionary. Combine that with some of the most memorable set pieces, and it\u2019s hard not to get sucked into the world of City 17.\r\n\r\nThe AI is still impressive even by today\u2019s standards, with enemies reacting to your movements and using the environment to their advantage. The combat is diverse, and there\u2019s a nice mix of shootouts, vehicle segments, and platforming. Plus, the pacing is spot on\u2014there\u2019s never a dull moment.\r\n\r\nVisually, Half-Life 2 was a stunner back in 2004, and while the graphics might look dated now, the art design, lighting, and atmosphere still give it a timeless feel. The environments, from the ruined cities to the eerie coastlines, are still some of the best-designed in any game.\r\n\r\nHalf-Life 2 isn\u2019t just a great shooter; it\u2019s an experience. The narrative, the gameplay, and the world it builds come together in a way few games can match. If you haven't played it yet, you\u2019re missing out on a true gaming classic.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nIncredible world-building and storytelling\r\nRevolutionary physics with the gravity gun\r\nDiverse and satisfying combat\r\nGreat AI and smart enemy behavior\r\nStunning atmosphere and level design\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nSome sections can feel a bit slow or repetitive\r\nGraphics are a bit dated by modern standards, but the atmosphere still shines\r\n\r\nThis is one of those games that set the bar for first-person shooters, and it\u2019s still an absolute must-play.

The game starts to dip a bit in Episode 1 where it's quite generic gameplay, and yes it is more HL2 I still find it a bit boring since it sticks to the same City 17 setting. Episode 2 on the other hand is quite fun, the setting feels like a breath of fresh air and it doesn't feel like it drags on. The hunters while being quite tanky and annoying were really terrifying at first. Where it falls flat again is the strider section. I hate that part for the life of me.

The story is still captivating, and the setting remains immersive, but some of the game mechanics feel outdated. While it has a strong narrative and a memorable protagonist in Gordon Freeman, the experience feels slower and less fluid compared to modern shooters.\n\nGameplay: \u2699\ufe0f\nThe gameplay, which once felt revolutionary, is now showing its age. The physics engine was ahead of its time, and it still stands out in some puzzles and combat sequences. However, the gunplay feels a bit clunky compared to more modern FPS titles, and the AI, while decent for its time, can feel a bit predictable now. The pacing also fluctuates, with some sections feeling unnecessarily drawn out, and the lack of significant upgrades to gameplay mechanics can make the experience feel stale at times. While it still offers fun moments, it\u2019s hard to ignore its dated feel.\n\nConclusion: \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\nHalf-Life 2 is undeniably a classic and a must-play for fans of the genre, but it\u2019s hard to overlook how much it\u2019s aged. The story, atmosphere, and puzzles still hold up, but the outdated mechanics and slower pacing can make it a tough sell for newcomers who are used to more polished, fast-paced shooters. It\u2019s a game that paved the way for many of today\u2019s best FPS titles, but it might not have the same impact now as it did when it first released.\n\nRating:

The guns just felt a lot more fun to use and the enemies were incredibly well designed.\nThe physics were satisfying in that almost everything could be interacted with in some way. Gravity gun was fun to play with. I wish they kept some idle gun animations like they had in the original, it was cool to stand still and have the character move the gun around and observe it.\n\nIt wasn't quite as difficult as Half Life, but I think that's a good thing.

Even after all these years, it still holds up as one of the greatest FPS experiences ever made. The story, the atmosphere, the gameplay\u2014everything just works. It\u2019s the kind of game that makes you wonder, \"Why can\u2019t more modern shooters be this good?\"\n\nThis game came out 2 weeks before my 2nd birthday, here I am 21 years later writing about how much of a masterpiece it STILL is.\n\nFrom the moment you step into City 17, you know you\u2019re in for something special. The world feels alive (in a dystopian, \"Big Brother is watching\" kind of way), the characters are memorable, and the pacing is chef\u2019s kiss. One minute, you\u2019re exploring a desolate highway, the next, you\u2019re fighting through zombie-infested tunnels with a gravity gun and a saw blade. And speaking of the gravity gun\u2014this thing changed gaming. It made physics fun, something most shooters still fail to do today.\n\nOf course, this is Valve we\u2019re talking about, so naturally, there\u2019s one big problem: Where is Half-Life 3? We\u2019ve been waiting for nearly two decades, and all we got was Half-Life: Alyx (which is amazing, but not what we asked for). It\u2019s like Valve made one of the best games of all time and then just said, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re done now.\u201d\n\nBut despite the heartbreak of never getting a true sequel, Half-Life 2 remains a must-play. It\u2019s the reason we have so many incredible FPS mechanics today, and even in 2025, it\u2019s still better than most shooters on the market.\n\nTL;DR:\nAn all-time classic that still holds up. Amazing story, perfect pacing, and the gravity gun is legendary. The only downside? Valve refuses to make Half-Life 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1740529210, "timestamp_updated": 1740529210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "64180365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126272156", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 9610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8351, "deck_playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1741299221}, "language": "english", "review": "Source engine has consumed my brain\nGravity Gun \"MM_SOUP\" ", "timestamp_created": 1582784150, "timestamp_updated": 1740528165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494699656963348389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "188761337", "author": {"steamid": "76561199504223535", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 992, "last_played": 1740693288}, "language": "english", "review": "Game very good, i love half man, and also gman too", "timestamp_created": 1740527603, "timestamp_updated": 1740527603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "188761295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845055753", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1106, "last_played": 1741147325}, "language": "english", "review": "PEAK", "timestamp_created": 1740527527, "timestamp_updated": 1740527527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "188758350", "author": {"steamid": "76561199256426042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "playtime_at_review": 1442, "last_played": 1742173486}, "language": "english", "review": "Changed my life", "timestamp_created": 1740523168, "timestamp_updated": 1740523168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "188758061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068724539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1890, "last_played": 1739838003}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most important games of my life and the reason I started playing games on PC.

My coding literacy is lacking.\n\nBut I find how it functions in-game to be fun, the way it simulates physics is the most realistic, and I feel, hasn't been replicated by any other game besides LittleBigPlanet. The mentioned game is a PlayStation title created by [b]Media Molecule.[/b]\n\nThe gravity gun showcases how items can interact with the world and against hostile NPCs such as headcrabs. Using blunt force in this fashion isn't something you come across much in other games.\n\n[h2]Story:[/h2]\nI haven't finished the story just yet, but I'm nearly towards the end.\n\nSo far, it's an interesting story but I'm not a writer so I couldn't give any technical knowledge about its structure or composition. It has Star Trek levels of scientific insight, you can easily tell that collage graduates with multiple PhDs and doctorates wrote all of these sci-fi elements.\n\n[h2]Weapon variety:[/h2]\nI'm not a weapons expert, but I still enjoy the weapon choices. As I've checked from YouTube videos discussing how Half-Life 1 is designed to make you think before you act, I'm sure Half-Life 2 works the same way. These are designed as utilities as well as defensive tools, it's not exclusively about killing hostiles.\n\nThe multiple options are there to give you different ways to experiment and solve a puzzle.", "timestamp_created": 1740410719, "timestamp_updated": 1740425265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508874237537384033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "188674856", "author": {"steamid": "76561199200357980", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 423, "last_played": 1740419114}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game, could play it over and over again", "timestamp_created": 1740423622, "timestamp_updated": 1740423622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182079974", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044664915", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2445, "last_played": 1734031073}, "language": "english", "review": "best game made by (along with half-life 1)\nnothing better will ever be created unless its by Valve\n\namen", "timestamp_created": 1733521788, "timestamp_updated": 1740423411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186860044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068219493", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "playtime_at_review": 6722, "last_played": 1742357534}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life 2 is a must-play FPS.

It essentially kickstarted Valve's era of making memorable games in the Source engine (which is still capable of making great environments to this day), and this game does have good set pieces and level design.\n\nWhen I first reviewed this game after beating it, I gave it a perfect 10/10 on the count of me never having played Half Life 1 before, and the fact that I had learned of all its in-jokes from playing so much Garry's Mod. 212 hours later, multiple deep dives into this game's cut content, and several playthroughs of Half Life 1 later, Half Life 2 just does not stand on its own for me.\n\nSo why am I re-reviewing this now, you ask? To answer that, I'd like to ask you something; What did Half Life 2 even innovate? Why did this game NEED to come out as it shipped in 2004?\n\nYou might say, \"Because of the physics!\" Alright, cool, but Psy-Ops, Postal II, Max Payne 2, and Hitman had physics engines long before this game did. \"Oh, but they weren't as well used.\" All this game uses its physics engine for is overusing the gravity gun, counter-weight puzzles here and there, and an overrated, contrived E3 Demo. Sure, it's fun to use the gravity gun to chuck physics objects at enemies and send them flying with all of the rather conveniently-placed barrels and pallets strewn everywhere, but that wears off once you realize that using the shotgun and pulse rifle is always going to be the dominant strategy. \n\nThe weapons are actually where I have the most amount of grievances with Half Life 2. In Half Life 1, you began with your standard pistols, SMGs, a shotgun, and grenades. All of them were viable, even into the later chapters, but where it really shone were the experimental weapons, like the Tau Cannon and the Alien Grunt's Hive Hand. The difference between these weapons and the Gravity Gun in Half Life 2 is that the developers didn't rub in your face how cool it was, they just introduced them when the time was right and when it made sense to give you these new weapons. The expansion packs did even better with this, introducing the Barnacle, Shock Roach, and Displacer Cannon in Opposing Force that allowed you to traverse the levels in new ways and were legitimately good alternatives to your standard hitscan guns.\n\nGiven all of this, how does Half Life 2 handle its weapon roster? A bug ball that doesn't even need to be used for the chapter its in, and a physics gimmick that overstays its welcome since it's given to you not even halfway through. Instead of coming up with cool alien weapons for the enemy to use, they have them shoot pellet guns at you for the entire runtime. There is no point to this, you've already committed to the alien invasion plot, you wouldn't spoil anything by having more than ONE futuristic gun for the player to use. That isn't to say Half Life 2 has nothing satisfying to its gunplay, it certainly does when it comes to providing visual feedback, but at some point it becomes repetitive to shoot the same exact grunt over and over. \n\nNow let's get to the story, which is one thing the game always gets praised for. Ah yes, because I remember the [i]best[/i] part of Half Life being the first chapter where nothing happens for 10 minutes before the game lets you get to the good stuff. In Half Life 2, Valve decided to make the most boring part of Half Life into two chapters of dialogue that Gordon can't be a part of, and thus can't connect us with in any meaningful way.\n\n\"Oh, ha ha ha, isn't Barney so silly, the way he always said he'd buy you a beer and how Gordon totally knows who he is despite every security guard in Black Mesa being the same character model?\" \n\nIt's insulting to your intelligence, and it's tedious to listen to each time you play through the game. Half Life 1 kept character dialogue out because Valve knew the limitations of Gordon not being able to speak, and it was about escaping a stressful disaster scenario where there isn't time for lengthy dialogue. Half Life 2, on the other hand, has the characters put on a smug face every time they reference a random detail about the first game or make a quip that makes you either cringe or smile along with them the first time and only the first time. \n\nThe last thing that sucks a lot of the joy out of Half Life 2 for me is the setting. This game went through a lot of changes to its art style and vision during its 6 years of development, and I'd blame the leak for a lot of this. The Combine are just not that interesting, nor are they anywhere near as oppressive as everyone says they are. This is supposed to be an apocalyptic story of alien oppressors controlling the Earth as its natural life is dying off, and yet: \n\n-The Coast is almost perfectly intact, with rather decent water levels given the 20 year gap between these two games\n-City 17 is in really good shape despite the 7-hour-war that took place offscreen destroying cities and supposedly introducing Xen fauna into the Earth's ecosystem\n-Every character distracts from it by making jokes and doing nothing but praising Gordon as a messiah despite him being a large part of the reason for why the world is as fucked as it is.\n\nSomething tells me that this is because of the playtesters Valve hired. They had all these amazing concepts for returning enemies from the first game like Bullsquids, Houndeyes, and Gargantuas as well as entirely new enemies like the Hydra and Combine Guards and Stalkers, but all it took was a playtester saying \"Hydra isn't fun because I don't feel like God when I fight it\" for any ideas to get dropped. Because Valve couldn't bear the idea of you not feeling like the reincarnation of Jesus, any sense of futility or hopelessness against the state of this world can't last for more than 20 minutes, and any plot threads from Half Life 1 were dropped because too many people cried over the Xen chapters. Because of this, HL2's enemy roster ended up being zombies, antlions that die in one hit from a shotgun, and humanoids with zero personality. It really has not aged well.\n\nSo, what's my new verdict on Half Life 2? It is good if you're a fan of the franchise, but it is not the greatest game ever made by any stretch, nor was it really all that influential. It certainly has its moments, but I'm glad people can now realize that it is not a proper sequel to Half Life and the marketing made it look much better than it was. I highly recommend you to play the Episodes, though, and chances are I'll make a review of those that'll be far more positive, because I think even Valve was disappointed with the direction this game had to go at the last minute and wanted to give it a make-over. \n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1591731569, "timestamp_updated": 1740334951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "188596578", "author": {"steamid": "76561199221198438", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 197, "playtime_at_review": 3641, "last_played": 1742504426}, "language": "english", "review": "this is kinda like detroit i guess idk", "timestamp_created": 1740330381, "timestamp_updated": 1740330381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "188595769", "author": {"steamid": "76561199566215718", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6099, "last_played": 1741472346}, "language": "english", "review": "most addicting game ever because you can play in a million different ways and do whatever u desire. the story is rich and the gameplay is good even for the millionth time.", "timestamp_created": 1740329709, "timestamp_updated": 1740329709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "188587942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067561084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1115, "last_played": 1740543137}, "language": "english", "review": "The whole series still holds up.

It removes most of the cheap deaths you could have, and have you taking part into action more often.\n\nThis game is packed with Episode 1 and 2 (whose should actually be played after you play Half-Life 2 if you want to follow the story, because the chronology of this game is odd).\nIt also has support to mods, if you want to alter your gameplay experience.\nThe only disappointment is that this game has no multiplayer support, which is a pity, because this game would be nice to play the campaign with friends.\n\nLike the first game, this game offers a kind of cinematic experience, where as Gordon Freeman, you pass through his journey throughout the plot of the game, while also meeting new characters, be they friends or foes.\n\nThe first game, which is Half-Life 2, and I'll call episode 0, is the lone journey of Gordon until he reaches the citadel. He will meet many friends along the way, and also foes. Some acts introduce new mechanics you can use and abuse through the acts they're useable, which makes the gameplay a lot more fun. I actually had lots of fun with the acts where I used the pheromone pod to command an army of antlions.\n\nThe second game, Half-Life 2 Episode 1, has Alyx accompanying you, as you two try to escape from the Citadel. The acts are actually really short, and you'll probably be blazing through it if you play for a few hours. If you like Alyx, this act is for you.\nSadly, it doesn't introduce much new stuff you can play with.\n\nThe third game, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, also has Alyx accompanying with you for most of the playthrough, but at certain moments you'll either be alone, or accompanied by a Vortigaunt (plot reasons). The acts are actually longer, and also has a enjoyable gameplay experience too. Just in my opinion, the final boss fight of the act is really straining, even if you're playing on Easy mode.\n\nAfter passing through this whole journey, while also having mods to alter my experience and make things funny, I had a good time with this game, and the story made me interested. Sadly, the game ends with a cliff hanger at the end of Episode 2, which explains why lots of people keep saying they want Half-Life 3.\nI don't think Half-Life 3 would be necessary, but an Episode 3 to finish what 2 ended would do.\n\nAnyways, due to the mod support, this game will have access also to user created content, so players can make new campaigns and stuff for the game. I even was playing an adventure one that was in spanish (but couldn't proceed because a paper I had to read had a glow obstructing my view).\n\nAnyways, this game is fun, and I had a greater time here than on Half-Life. But still, is still a pity that there's no multiplayer support.\nI'm aware Synergy exists, but that mod seems really buggy. But anyways, feel free to get this game and play, because you'll like it.\n\nAnd if you want to increment you experience, download a few wacky mods :).\nJust enjoy the ride, heh.", "timestamp_created": 1735699441, "timestamp_updated": 1735699518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184386362", "author": {"steamid": "76561199266687926", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 152, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1742602489}, "language": "english", "review": "Half life is gud release Half-Life 3 NOW!!", "timestamp_created": 1735697259, "timestamp_updated": 1735697259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "34676008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306981200", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1436, "last_played": 1588373537}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1504326845, "timestamp_updated": 1735694238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521823763847351074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184383037", "author": {"steamid": "76561199804074874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1736575850}, "language": "english", "review": "cliner made my house look like a snowglobe and all my hair came of my pretty bald head", "timestamp_created": 1735694027, "timestamp_updated": 1735694027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184382878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261171341", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 648, "last_played": 1736031831}, "language": "english", "review": "its gods gift from the masters of valve", "timestamp_created": 1735693872, "timestamp_updated": 1735693872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184382515", "author": {"steamid": "76561199232271089", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1041, "last_played": 1735693475}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, mid ep", "timestamp_created": 1735693510, "timestamp_updated": 1735693510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184381411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324356100", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 665, "last_played": 1585182367}, "language": "english", "review": "l&b blues 13.75", "timestamp_created": 1735692476, "timestamp_updated": 1735692505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184379916", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095305048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 996, "last_played": 1739052123}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, especially for its age.

Nothing too hard and quite fun. \n\nWith the 20th Anniversary Update, Episodes 1 and 2 were added to Half-Life 2. So, if you\u2019re going for 100% completion, you\u2019ll need to grab all the Episode 1 and 2 achievements too. If you already unlocked them in the standalone games, you can import your save, and the achievements will autopop. If not (like me), you\u2019ll have to get them again in Half-Life 2.\n\nThe achievements aren\u2019t too hard, but some are definitely annoying. In Episode 1, you\u2019re only allowed to fire a single bullet the entire time - challenging, but doable. Episode 2 has you carrying a garden gnome through the whole episode. It starts out fun but gets frustrating fast, especially when you\u2019re trying to drive it around in the car.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the \u201ckill 333 grubs\u201d achievement in Episode 2. Honestly, it\u2019s near impossible without a guide, so I\u2019d highly recommend checking out Cynic 0055\u2019s achievement guides - they\u2019re super helpful. The rest of the achievements aren\u2019t too bad and shouldn\u2019t give you much trouble.\n\nAll that remains is one final question: where HL3? o_O", "timestamp_created": 1730148800,

"review": "After completing the main game of Half-Life 2, I can\u2019t help but feel that it\u2019s overrated. While it's often regarded as one of the greatest games of all time, I found it to be a mixed bag, especially compared to its predecessor, Half-Life 1.\n\nOne of my main gripes with the game is how frequently it left me feeling bored and even dizzy. The pacing seemed inconsistent, with moments that dragged on far longer than necessary. Additionally, the level design was often frustrating, as I found myself losing my way multiple times, which disrupted the flow of the story and made progression feel more tedious than engaging.\n\nThat being said, I can appreciate why Half-Life 2 was groundbreaking in its time. Released in 2004, it boasted a good attention to detail, and voice acting. If I had played it closer to its original release, I might have rated it more favorably for these innovations.\n\nFor now, I\u2019m planning to continue with Episode One, Episode Two, and Lost Coast to see if these expansions can change my perspective. Maybe they\u2019ll highlight what so many fans find special about this series and make the overall experience more enjoyable for me.\n\nUpdate #1:\nI just finished Ep1, i dont know why but i liked it way more than the main one, i will definitely continue with Ep2, the ending got me intrigue to see the end of the story\n\nUpdate #2:\nI finished Episode 2 two weeks ago, and much like Episode 1, I found it thoroughly enjoyable. That said, I still consider Episode 1 the strongest entry in the series so far. but I can\u2019t help feeling frustrated by the ending of Episode 2. How could they leave the story on such a cliffhanger and then leave fans waiting for 17 years (and counting) without any closure? It\u2019s easy to see why the open-ended story has left fans feeling both deeply attached and incredibly frustrated over the years", "timestamp_created": 1733033547, "timestamp_updated": 1736173336, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465178608894348145", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184930033", "author": {"steamid": "76561199207990219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 658, "last_played": 1736209525}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1736171624, "timestamp_updated": 1736171624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184927705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203966919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1528, "last_played": 1736182987}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply a perfect game in every way, if you haven't played it yet, now is the perfect time!", "timestamp_created": 1736169669, "timestamp_updated": 1736169669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506172835826873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168178926", "author": {"steamid": "76561199116413509", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3177, "last_played": 1736353609}, "language": "english", "review": "You can save Laszlo now", "timestamp_created": 1719334456, "timestamp_updated": 1736162202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184919234", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004082219", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1488, "last_played": 1737387255}, "language": "english", "review": "what an incredible game this is. perfect for those who want the best optimized graphics on older hardware", "timestamp_created": 1736161282, "timestamp_updated": 1736161282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184913360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101977235", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1197, "last_played": 1738364009}, "language": "english", "review": "\"You don't need a voice to make a choice\" - a harsh irony that pretty much describes the whole Half-Life franchise.

Like a problem of how averages leave out outliers, and how your testing sample differs from the gaming population average, so there is a larger pool of outliers than expected. \n\nEventually relying on averages of data is just noise and misleading, because its averages of averages of samples. Eventually there is just more outlier than in-grouper. And thats when you fail, thats when philosophy fails, thats when institutions fail, thats when science fails. Its like an echo chamber. If you keep appealing to average, eventually you are appealing to just people who are too afraid to stand out in any way shape or form. \n\nSo designing a smooth experience tho, to impress upon journalists or something, that might not really require a multilayered approach. But for longevity more than just legend, you would want to have a multi-layer approach. Like, tall people exist too, need to make some tall clothes not just average american wide.\n\nThis isn't really anything new I'm saying and I don't wanna give a false impression of what kind of person I am. Like, Pyro and Sniper are examples of classes with lower skill floor. So I'm sure some have design philosophy already. Idk the costs of it. But if we look at how much players got the crowbar, vs, how many made it past that flood the room level, more than 20% of players were lost in that timeframe. I felt it, but I kept going. So just saying, there was some kind of assumption forming about how a person tries to problem solve, that effects the game pacing. And if the gamer doesn't know what Gman or the developers are expecting you to do, then they're just guessing n checking. And then if their guess could work part way but is artificially designed to not work, it just feels disincentivizing to think of creative solutions. \n\nFor example, oil floats on water, nice. Why does me jumping on a barrel in water make it explode? Its better, to let me go with my method through the pipe, then realize 'oh I need to fill this chamber with water to ascend.' Than to like, explode, and then be left wondering. When I was in the other room, I saw the health crate and my mind completely didnt notice the valve it was under. Perhaps this is a monkey trap of sorts. Adhd, or just being near-sighted so am not used to seeing wide, or perhaps my color saturation was a bit low so didn't notice the valve which was red. And, other ladders, sometimes I had that problem of visibility with to. But because of the sharpness of the edge of the steps of the ladder, them blending into their environment wasn't a big deal, but I think with different pc or settings it might have been too blended in. And this could explain the 20% dropoff. \n\nSo a real solution might be, to make jank rigs with jank settings and see how smoothly it plays. Like, a problem of over-standardization of testing perhaps. Maybe you could make a project computer that can emulate a wide variety of types of computers so you can rapidly test various experiences, without requiring multiple pcs or reassembly. But perhaps this problem is solved with the Steam OS stuff in a way. \n\nLol I'm not professional at anything I just like trying to understand random stuff sometimes.\n\nMy FOV was prolly too high it seems.

after a long time. And I'm going to be real, the game is not that great. I got here after playing Half-Life and the expansions, and they were nice. Half Life was good and Opposing Force was even better, in my opinion. Half-Life 2 is something else entirely though, and depending on who you are, that might be a good or a bad thing. \n\nComing from the previous game, I hated the airboat section. After playing Half-Life 1, it feels like it was disrespectful to the player's resource management. But, it also teaches the player how the game works, because at the end of the segment, the game makes sure to basically refill your entire health and energy, and give you more ammo than you entered the section with. Half-Life 2 almost always makes sure you have what you need. It's a kind game, and that's nice.  While I'm talking about airboats though, I gotta say something. Did you know that airboats are real? Like they're not something made up for Half-Life 2! My mind was blown when I found out. \n\nThe game has a bit of tech demo energy to it. It feels like a bunch of smaller parts of different games stitched together. Especially the two different vehicle sections split up by a little area with like... horror elements. It's kind of funny.\n\nThere's a part of the game where you get people who follow you around, and command them, but they never stay when you tell them to, it feels almost like they want to get killed. ): The AI foes aren't shy about tossing grenades, and it feels like they're somewhat tactical about it, there's this stairway where they get to blow up 4 squad members with a grenade at a time. It's somewhat humorous. \n\nThis game is fine, it's totally not the best, but it has a little bit of charm to it. I had fun in parts, and other parts made me groan. Overall Half-Life 2 is an okay game. However, now that Episode 1 and 2 are part of the game, I can't really recommend this game to people. Did you ever buy an Early Access game and you are looking forward to the next update, and then the developers decide not to add anything to the game for the next decade? That's this game, this is the Early Access game where the developers never finish the game, that's what Half-Life 2 and the Episodes are.", "timestamp_created": 1739057734, "timestamp_updated": 1739057734, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456820398569107056", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "187507332", "author": {"steamid": "76561199130142624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1055, "last_played": 1739056685}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've played even though its 20 years old", "timestamp_created": 1739056720, "timestamp_updated": 1739056720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "121439552", "author": {"steamid": "76561199186735201", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6381, "last_played": 1740676284}, "language": "english", "review": "i like it", "timestamp_created": 1661803278, "timestamp_updated": 1739055801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527607381343841553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "187506247", "author": {"steamid": "76561199756595356", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "playtime_at_review": 413, "deck_playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1742595544}, "language": "english", "review": "i have 6.9 hours making 69 rn\ud83d\ude00\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1739055662, "timestamp_updated": 1739055662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, {"recommendationid": "187505479", "author": {"steamid": "76561199469419483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1604, "last_played": 1739054851}, "language": "english", "review": "for all types of gamers", "timestamp_created": 1739054872, "timestamp_updated": 1739054872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "187505409", "author": {"steamid": "76561199568181063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 814, "last_played": 1739057709}, "language": "english", "review": "it's a game", "timestamp_created": 1739054802, "timestamp_updated": 1739054802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "187504799", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968810061", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1739138770}, "language": "english", "review": "20 years later, it still stands as one of the greatest games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1739054254, "timestamp_updated": 1739054254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "187503064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123601175", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1739974414}, "language": "english", "review": "its so good and fun", "timestamp_created": 1739052665, "timestamp_updated": 1739052665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "187501173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025984437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1521, "last_played": 1739041910}, "language": "english", "review": "I think, you don't need read any reviews, to know what kind of game masterpiece it is.

classic and one of the most influential games in the history of the medium. When it came out in 2004, it revolutionized both physics in games, and the presentation of all FPS games coming after it. Although I prefer the original Half Life more than this one, I still think it's an excellent game and I very much enjoy it. The only complaint I possibly have is that it isn't paced as well as Half Life. Otherwise, it builds upon all the mechanics of its source, and innovates and expands the experience. Since a couple months ago, they did an update on the game, which gave general QoL improvements and merged the two episodes into the main game. The episodes are great too, and I only hate that episode two ended on a cliffhanger 18 years ago and there are still no plans to continue the story. Overall, I very much recommend everyone to try and play Half Life and Half Life 2 at least once. Both casual gamers and fans of fps.

Tambi\u00e9n las mejoras que tiene este juego en la parte gr\u00e1fica permiten que la historia se disfrute mucho m\u00e1s y hasta se entienda mejor. \r\n\r\nTodo el tiempo de juego que tengo constituye tanto la historia principal como los dos episodios que contin\u00faan la historia y la verdad bastante bien. Recomend\u00e9 en el 1 jugar directamente Black Mesa as\u00ed que este, al no tener un remaster, hay que comprarlo s\u00ed o s\u00ed pero considero que adem\u00e1s de que es obligatorio vale bien lo que cueste (que no s\u00e9 si es mucho la verdad). En caso de que no moleste jugar el 1 original recomendar\u00eda comprar el pack que tiene Steam con todos los juegos de Valve para as\u00ed poder jugar tambi\u00e9n los DLC's que sacaron. En ese sentido me gust\u00f3 que ya venga todo incluido en este juego y no haya que comprar los dos episodios adicionales ya que luego de terminar la historia principal es necesario seguir con esos (y hubiera sido un baj\u00f3n tener que comprarlos aparte)\r\n\r\nMe pareci\u00f3 un juego bastante bueno, ya hab\u00eda le\u00eddo que algunos lo consideran de los mejores de la historia y tampoco es que les falte raz\u00f3n. Si bien tiene sus puntos a mejorar en cosas que no me gustaron como el hecho de que se puedan desviar los proyectiles del lanzacohetes (bastante molesto) o la \"mec\u00e1nica\" que agregaron de poder prender fuego los barriles y poder matar a los bichos que se cuelgan del techo de una (aunque teni\u00e9ndolo que calcular bien, yo simplemente les disparaba para hacerlo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido), me gust\u00f3 m\u00e1s que el 1 porque siento que se explot\u00f3 mucho m\u00e1s el mundo abierto (el cap\u00edtulo del coche donde hay que recorrer ciudades y lootearlas, mi favorito) y con las mejoras

As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine.\n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles. Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane.\n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs.\n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 - A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1737785868, "timestamp_updated": 1737785868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "8245363", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968564598", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1420, "last_played": 1710183805}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever!", "timestamp_created": 1387871645, "timestamp_updated": 1737778495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186343670", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112274708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 641, "last_played": 1738006548}, "language": "english", "review": "um filme em q voc\u00ea \u00e9 o protagonista", "timestamp_created": 1737777342, "timestamp_updated": 1737777342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186341962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147075126", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1334, "last_played": 1737774592}, "language": "english", "review": "I understand now.", "timestamp_created": 1737775174, "timestamp_updated": 1737775174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186341018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136332550", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1180, "last_played": 1738449035}, "language": "english", "review": "The Half Life series is amazing!

And before you say it, yes, I understand that the game came out in 2004. And I can enjoy games that came out then, and even before then. All things considered, I was actually pretty impressed with the graphics, sound quality, and physics. So I didn't dislike the game because of that. No, I disliked the game simply for having bad gameplay. Ah yes, gameplay, the one thing people always forget to mention when praising this game. Oh the physics, oh the story, oh the blah blah blah. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the whole point of playing a game to idk PLAY a game?! Maybe I have a different sense of fun than most people, but going from point a to b to y to z because the teleporter broke just isn't my cup of tea. And during that track of a to b etc., you get encountered with an glorious obstacle that you'll have to repeat ad nauseam for the next hour. Because apparently filling levels with obstacle maneuvering is more fun than filling it with action, which is a lot to ask for, especially considering that this is an FPS! But all of that pales in comparison to the vehicle sections, which is by far the jankiest experience I have EVER had operating a vehicle in any video game. The speed bike from Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy handled better than the vehicles in this game. \n\nHonestly I tried with this game, and it's not like I didn't want to like it. I liked HL1, and can totally understand why people like it. But not this game, NOT this game.\n\nWith that all being said, should you play HL2? Yes, but only because on sale this game is around $1 and change. Thus it's worth it to play it past the refund period in order to experience the hype and cultivate your own opinion. \n\nMay the crowbar be with you.", "timestamp_created": 1737745392, "timestamp_updated": 1737745392, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429955035448074341", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186312866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325550211", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 222, "playtime_at_review": 1382, "last_played": 1741552328}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a classic for a reason.", "timestamp_created": 1737743289, "timestamp_updated": 1737743289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186311267", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993957863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5704, "last_played": 1738349315}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes, it's a FPS game, but it's much more.

Half Life 2 still deserves the attention of every person who's enjoying playing games out there (and not only theirs). [/h1] \n\nIts gameplay and storyline are so solid, and the first person experience is just exemplary!! It handles all the mechanics so majestically and combines \"REAL LIFE physics\" puzzles (meaning that you can think and act like you would in real life) with an amazing artificial intelligence attached to everything. The world you've being introduced is perfectly composed, with every little detail pretty well fitted in. But the strong point here is the storytelling. From the eyes of Dr. Freeman, the player gets the chance to REALLY live the story and do things that he could never imagine doing in a videogame.

The new update finally combines the base game and the episodes, making it seamless to play, as well as touching up on its visuals and fixing some bugs. Workshop support is added, which means modding the game will be easier this time around with mods offering visual tweaks and some minor bug fixing, as well as model swapping some NPCs to make the game such as mess to play. \n\nThere are things that did not age well such as the janky physics system (which can be funny to watch tbh). pacing in some chapters that can drag replayability, bland gunplay that makes combat unsatisfying, as well as the squad AI being unreliable in some areas. But even with these faults, Half-Life 2 offers seamless integration of narrative and gameplay where it feels seamless to play instead of just watching a cutscene and going into gameplay. I still think that Valve is the only developer that does this perfectly, where it is replicated in Portal and Left 4 Dead. \n\nHalf-Life 2 still stood the test of time that built the foundation of AAA for better or for worse. Either way, I highly recommend this game not only for historic purposes and probably lamenting that Valve didn't make Episode 3, but also experience this great game. \n\n(sidenote: if you plan to subscribe to workshop items, do not subscribe to more than 40 mods, as this can break subtitles)", "timestamp_created": 1732933714, "timestamp_updated": 1732933714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "180935021", "author": {"steamid": "76561199445728710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1490, "last_played": 1732936887}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked the part where Gordon made it to the citidel and uh Hatsune Miku was there and sang world is mine", "timestamp_created": 1732933426, "timestamp_updated": 1732933426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "180934642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353116262", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 3792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2377, "last_played": 1740713883}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't believe Valve added Wega to Half Life 2", "timestamp_created": 1732933274, "timestamp_updated": 1732933274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "180931691", "author": {"steamid": "76561199379349471", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 500, "last_played": 1740189532}, "language": "english", "review": "it halfed my life 2", "timestamp_created": 1732932081, "timestamp_updated": 1732932081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "124141677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991722753", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2430, "last_played": 1740333256}, "language": "english", "review": "its half life, its great, even after 20 years!", "timestamp_created": 1666322055, "timestamp_updated": 1732931780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "180929872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059572427", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 942, "last_played": 1732931367}, "language": "english", "review": "This is peak PC gaming, it's astonishing how well a 20 year old game holds up to and surpasses modern games.

It came as part of the Orange Box, which I had purchased in order to play Portal.  After playing through that game a few times, I decided to try HL2 out.  It was a great experience.  Since getting into PC gaming over the last decade, I have played through it a few more times.  \n\nHalf-Life 2 is one of those canonical games; it gets to have its name mentioned in the \"greatest game ever\" conversations.  I'm not terribly interested in those discussions, since A) games vary so much and B) I haven't played a lot of the ones that people bring up in this connection.  \n\nWhat I can say is this; Half-Life 2 has a great many virtues.  I think its best attribute is intuitive gameplay; there are so many little things that you figure out in the game, whether they are puzzle solving or combat-related, without NPCs (or, worse yet, Freeman himself) telling you what to do (this is what made me stop playing Batman: Arkham Asylum; I was sick of Bats saying things such as, \"I should go through the vents.\"  I'm the world's greatest detective; I can figure this shit out on my own.  Why the fu-).\n\nThe game also holds up largely well from a design standpoint.  The characters look lifelike enough without falling down the uncanny valley; the style of the game's environments is fairly plain, which is fine, since this alien-dominated world would doubtless be rather drab and drear.  I think the soundtrack fits the game well, though it's not one I listen to outside the game.  \n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is the way it tells its story.  It's a good story, but it's mostly done through locking you in rooms with other characters, who exposit for a few minutes, then open the doors back up so you can go about the gameplay.  Contrast with games like Dead Space or BioShock or Deus Ex, where you are frequently contacted by people (less so in Dead Space, admittedly, but not infrequently) and come across audio/text logs that build the world.  While I appreciate that the story is all told in the game engine, having played the game through a few times, these sequences become a drag as I wait to get back to the gameplay.  \n\nAll in all, Half-Life 2 is a terrific game.

This was the \"killer app\" (along with Counter Strike) that truly launched Steam as a games platform. From the groundbreaking facial animations to the cryptic and alluring dystopian world, this was [b]the game[/b]. More than 20 years later, the game's stunning mechanics and clarity of vision stand as testaments to the power of focused games design and what can happen when game designers push the established boundaries.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nTwo words: Gravity Gun. This singular tool/weapon changed the face of first person shooters forever and cemented Half-Life 2 as the new gold standard for single player FPS games when it released. The ability to turn environmental junk into improvised projectiles is exciting and novel in ways that audiences at the time couldn't properly articulate. This is facilitated in large part by the Source Engine's premier physics capabilities, which far surpassed Havok and other engines of the day. Swinging cranes, knocking over stacks of objects (and enemies), using floating boxes as stepping stones, flinging debris, and using balance and weight to solve puzzles was (and still is) one of the most immersive and innovative mechanics in any video game then or since.\n\nOther weapons in the game are a delight to shoot, with a fantastically clean feel and just the right amount of kick. Certain weapons have an alt-fire mode which enhances their tactical options, and each weapon has a well-defined use-case in which it excels. From semi-auto pistols and meaty revolvers, to futuristic Combine machine guns, to (my personal favorite) the Resistance crossbow, each weapon is finely tuned and will have its own crop of fans who herald its effectiveness. Every one is adept at clearing legions of Combine soldiers, and all will need to be intelligently leveraged in order to progress.\n\nIn addition, the enemy AI was much more complex than other games of the time, with bad guys swarming, flanking, and retreating as their numbers dwindled. Gunfights are punchy, visceral affairs, and each skirmish feels unique and dire. Many times throughout the game, the player is ambushed or besieged and is forced to think on their feet, lest they be overrun. From headcrabs to Combine soldiers to striders, each new enemy type requires a new approach to beat, and will frequently see the player relying on nearby environmental factors in order to prevail. Set pieces tie seamlessly into the gameplay, and most obstacles make sense as organic parts of the game world, rather than feeling arbitrarily placed as in many other games. Levels and gameplay sections are frequently huge, and while this is mostly a great thing, there are times where these sections can drag on for far longer than they are welcome. Two notable areas in this regard are Route Kanal and Highway 17, both of which are largely vehicular in nature and feel much too long. Nova Prospekt was also a level that never seemed to end, and seemed strangely barren considering it was the point terminus for thousands of prisoners within the games own lore.\n\nAside from that, every level stands out as another unique portion of the arduous journey that Gordon Freeman must undergo in his mission to free humanity from the clutches of the Combine, and each level brings a design and character that is completely different from the last. The levels together paint a picture of a planet under siege, underlining the reckless destruction and oppression the Combine have visited upon the human race. From city streets to sewers, from prisons to pumping stations, and from bombed-out tenements to the Combine Citadel, each level has it's own challenges, obstacles, and feeling of upward progression. Without a doubt, this game excels at making you actually feel like [i]the[/i] Gordon Freeman. It's sublime.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nThe story of Half-Life 2 has been lauded for years as a pinnacle of writing and subtle exposition. As mentioned above, the levels themselves communicate volumes about the world and the predicament humans find themselves in, having been enslaved by a malevolent alien race after the events of the first Half-Life game. Once vibrant cities have been laid to waste, beautiful coasts and verdant fields have been destroyed from the Combine relentlessly siphoning natural resources off-world, and the human race has been oppressed, subjugated, and pushed to the brink of annihilation. Gordon Freeman has been...somewhere...since the events of Half-Life, and is transported to City 17 by the mysterious G-man to embark upon a campaign of liberation from the Combine's clutches. Alien technology abounds and fills the world with an uncomfortable, [i]assimilated[/i] feeling, and events in the game organically advance a growing sense of human resistance, struggle, and betrayal from within, such as the cold, clinical influence of Dr. Breen. One of the messages in the opening scenes of the game, \"Welcome to City 17, you have chosen, or [b]been chosen[/b], to relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers...\" is written so concisely to communicate all you need to know about the situation as the player, while leaving plenty of questions to be answered. This starting piece of the puzzle is continually built upon by well-acted and well-written bits of exposition delivered by characters new and old, and leads the player to a growing sense of dread as they begin to understand how grave the situation truly is. \n\nAs the player progresses in the game, new story bits are revealed, and the enemy response to the player's actions become ever more intense, lending a true sense of weight to the player's actions and breathing life into the world. Even in areas that feel barren and devoid of human presence, the spectre of the Combine's influence is felt and is an easy, organic justification to the palpable feeling of isolation. Gordon being labeled \"anti-citizen one\" is absolutely on-brand and enhances the notion that the player should not be doing what they're doing and they are not where they should be. In short, Half-Life 2 is deliciously dystopian and has established itself as a benchmark in world-building and character-driven exposition.\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nAs a 20+ year-old game which has never seen a true remaster, the graphics in HL2 are certainly dated. [i]That said[/i], the art direction, level design, and character models really do stand the test of time. Once locked into the superb gameplay, graphics become a secondary concern, and the colors and textures still do an excellent job of conveying the needed cues. Lights illuminate the way forward, darkness delivers apprehension and a sense of unknown danger, outside scenes are overcast and feel flat (in a good way), and props are lovingly crafted and placed to create a world that has been ravaged and destroyed. At the time of the game's release, point lighting was still a premier technology, and it has been used to great effect, showcasing stark, high-contrast scenes and making flame-lit tunnels and florescent-lit hallways both pop in their own ways. Water shaders, particle effects, and debris are competent, but have been surpassed many times over by newer technology in the intervening years. Still, they get the job done, and a recent 20-year anniversary update unlocked higher display resolutions, allowed newer effects, and helped open the game to a new generation of fans. Luckily, as stated above, the game is easily able to stand on gameplay and design elements. While a remaster or complete overhaul would be welcome, the game is 100% playable as-is and is very enjoyable even without the helpful lens of nostalgia.\n\nAll in all, Half-Life 2 is a testament to incredibly robust game design and easily stands as a true video game classic. For anyone who has never played it, Half-Life 2 will lead players on a grand adventure that is as unique as it is polished. In all ways, Half-Life 2 is a game for the ages.", "timestamp_created": 1734808424, "timestamp_updated": 1734811711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5,

A masterpiece that deserves all those players as it defines peak tech. When I first played Half Life I was completely in awe. Not just at how amazing it was, and I mean really amazing it has had some importance, but at the alien themes present in the FPS world. Awesome stuff. And when it became more and more popular than a bumbling babbling band of baboons (you know that's really popular), we all knew that there would be a sequel. I had nightmares about how they would stuff it up like they do with so many unwanted sequels before it. That's what they do with the videogames everyone loves (and I've only seen two people who didn't like the original, and they are escaped mental patients), they do stupid cheap-ass lame sequels so that we all lose faith in the video games industry ever making anything good ever again. Thankfully, this sequel is actually very good. That's right, you heard me, you aren't hallucinating. It's actually AMAZING! It's so much fun and a great improvement over the original (like I often do consider some sequels), with outstanding graphics and awesome gameplay and characters of the essence. It does kinda start off a bit slowly, but once it gets going, and more focused on the story and actual characters start to arrive, it's non-stop thrilling and killing.

Valve, as a developer, largely succeeded in the past, but they are now eclipsed by their endless failures. Counter Strike 2 was a joke. Dota Underlords was dead on arrival. Dota 2's situation is almost laughable, and Dota Artifact was sleep paralysis demon of every Triple A gaming exec. To them, it showed that taking risks and attempting to branch out was a grave mistake. It was a huge warning sign to all Triple A developers. Is risk inherently bad? No, but corporations want to mitigate risk and maximize profits. Can you blame them for their reaction to Valve's most damning failure? No. \n\nThe funniest part about all this is that Valve's only success in the past 10-15 years has been Alyx, which is VR exclusive. Personally, I believe this was a fluke. First of all, anything HL related will succeed and be praised. It's like From Software. They could release a Dark Souls Re-Remastered and the only change could be that invaders can't heal anymore and people would still get on their hands a knees and worship Miyizaki. I choose to give them the benefit of the doubt and will assume that Alyx is a good game. Still, locking their only competent work behind a VR headset is pretty hilarious.

1712419877}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Half-Life 2\" is one of the most influential and groundbreaking first-person shooters ever made. Released in 2004 by Valve, it redefined what players could expect from a video game in terms of both storytelling and gameplay. The game\u2019s narrative is immersive, unfolding without traditional cutscenes, which allows the player to feel like they are truly part of the story. The protagonist, Gordon Freeman, is a silent hero who navigates through a dystopian world filled with alien invaders and oppressive human forces. This unique approach to storytelling pulls the player into the game\u2019s world, making every action feel meaningful.\n\nThe physics engine in \"Half-Life 2\" was revolutionary for its time. The way objects interact with the environment feels natural and intuitive, and it became a major part of the gameplay. From solving puzzles using physics to creatively using the environment as a weapon, it was an innovation that influenced many games that followed. The gravity gun, which allows players to manipulate objects in real-time, is still one of the most memorable and fun weapons in gaming history.\n\nThe level design in \"Half-Life 2\" is another standout feature. The game introduces players to varied environments, from the dark, industrial city of City 17 to the eerie, remote marshlands. Each location feels carefully crafted, with attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. The pacing is also masterful, alternating between moments of intense combat and slower, atmospheric sequences that allow the player to soak in the environment and story.\n\nThe AI in \"Half-Life 2\" was also ahead of its time. Enemies behave intelligently, using cover, working together, and reacting to the player\u2019s actions in a way that makes combat more dynamic and challenging. The enemy variety, from the terrifying Combine soldiers to the creepy headcrabs, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The interactions with NPCs and the world around you help build a sense of tension and immersion, keeping you on edge throughout the experience.\n\nThe game's soundtrack, composed by Kelly Bailey, perfectly complements the atmosphere, using subtle but effective music to enhance both the action and the quieter moments. The sound design is top-notch, with ambient sounds adding to the immersion, whether you're in a busy city street or exploring a deserted warehouse.\n\nUltimately, \"Half-Life 2\" is a masterpiece that still holds up to this day. Its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and technical achievements make it a game that set a new standard for the industry. It\u2019s a game that\u2019s not just fun to play, but one that\u2019s easy to appreciate for the way it shaped the future of video games. Even though it\u2019s been years since its release, \"Half-Life 2\" remains a classic that continues to inspire both players and developers alike.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1738430425, "timestamp_updated": 1738430425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648899435997009277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186919784", "author": {"steamid": "76561199548392516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 309, "playtime_at_review": 760, "last_played": 1742579051}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1738428678, "timestamp_updated": 1738428678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "141520484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269299747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1732137910}, "language": "english", "review": "im jakeing it auuuuuugh", "timestamp_created": 1688734172, "timestamp_updated": 1738418698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "159647855", "author": {"steamid": "76561199590853404", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 10730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "playtime_at_review": 10188, "last_played": 1742429971}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, Valve really outdid themselves with this game.

This is the last game valve ever made. Anything after was not them. a 3rd entry to the half life franchise should be near identical to half life 2 in every step of the development cycle. If not, brace yourself for cs2, tf2 and half life alyx style ugly cartoon graphics, worse sound design, poor level design, characters with no soul, and overall  a much distant stray from what makes this game so perfect and critically acclaimed. This is not nostalgia goggles. Stop straying from the source material. Make half life 3. We want photo realistic graphics like half life 2. We want sounds so realistic that are near impossible to detect as if we are there in that moment. We want ground breaking physics and puzzles that can stump you if you try to speed run through.  We want memorable characters. We want coordinated enemies that feel alive and connected through a interdimensional force and WANT to kill you to fulfill their mission. Bring back the old artists, level designers, and sound designers from half life 2. Give us Half-Life 3 Deathmatch !!!!!! You know how to do it, So quit wasting time on cartoon garbage like Cs2 where everyone just cheats with aimbot and preys on children gambling with mummy and daddys credit card. The map making and dedicated heartfelt community for this game and counter-strike source may never be matched, but at least make an attempt to let us play half-life 3 sometime within the next 3 years. Stop watering down your prized and most anticipated series with nonsensical VR that no one even plays. At least modders made no VR mod though, right guys? Do it proper. You have a perfect example right in front of you. Half-Life 2. Award winning. Perfect. Just do it again, with updated photo realistic graphics, and todays physics engines, same beautiful music and sound design, intricate level design with a continuation of the story, whether its the old cannon or the new retcon..

It has good optimization, a remarkable visual style and atmosphere, well-constructed music, a captivating plot and storytelling, and immersive and rewarding gameplay. Hence, it is one of the greatest single-player first-person shooters ever created.\n\nThe game ran smoothly on my old low-end desktop (Dell OptiPlex) and mid-range gaming laptop (Lenovo Legion 5). Based on my experience, Valve optimized the game well for low-end and high-end computers. Therefore, encountering performance issues is usually only possible if your PC is very old or low-end.\n\nCurrent triple-A video games are significantly more realistic in terms of graphics compared to the ones present in video games produced a decade ago. While I love the first game's gameplay, its graphics could have aged better. It affected its degree of immersion, making some parts less impactful. Half-Life 2 does not have this issue, even if both were old games. It continues to be visually pleasing and mesmerizing. The atmosphere can still engross you and make you feel like you are Gordon Freeman himself. For instance, advancing through Ravenholm is still disturbing and frightening, and exploring Citadel is still mysteriously enticing. You can easily find beautiful artistic color lighting decisions for the game, especially at the prison in Nova Prospect and the streets of Ravenholm and City 17.\n\nEven though the game has a spectacular visual style, the music also played a large part in making the game enthralling. The soundtrack in each level adds a lot to the gameplay because its artists tailored it perfectly for the atmosphere. It cooperates with the other elements to create a great gaming experience. A massive component of the fear that I experienced while playing through the creepier parts of the game was due to the music playing. Additionally, the gunfights feel more fabulous when combined with the music.\n\nI will not discuss what happens in the story since you should experience it yourself. However, I will mention that it starts after the stasis of Gordon Freeman during Half-Life 1. Furthermore, Half-Life 2 is more story-driven than the first game. It has much more dialogue and exposition. Some players might not prefer it, but I think it makes the world much more compelling. With regards to its storytelling, it tells the story brilliantly through the environment and characters. Because the characters and the surroundings accurately reflect the current state of Half-Life's world, you can get a good grasp of the plot by just paying attention to these things. As a result, it takes less effort to follow and understand this game's story than in other games.\n\nWhat makes this game immersive is the physics and the lack of non-interactive cutscenes. Having so much freedom and agency to do many things puts you in the game and makes you feel like you are there. The combat also takes a long time to feel stale because the game always tries to mix things up. It either introduces a new type of weapon, another kind of enemy, a different way of playing,  or ways to utilize your surroundings for fighting. Other than the combat system, the puzzles are challenging and creative enough to be enjoyable and fresh. While I was watching other people's playthrough, I discovered that it is also possible to have alternative solutions to the puzzles. Thus, making the game more replayable.\n\nDue to the quality of optimization, style, story, music, and gameplay, many still consider Half-Life 2 as one of the best first-person shooters. Despite its age, it does not feel outdated and unfun. Video game fanatics can still find delight in playing this game. Therefore, I highly recommend it to people looking for an incredible single-player shooter experience.\n\nEDIT: The second episode was really good.", "timestamp_created": 1672478805, "timestamp_updated": 1738336088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.7263907790184021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186826853", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085572891", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 126, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1741532987}, "language": "english", "review": ":)\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1738334887, "timestamp_updated": 1738334887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186826332", "author": {"steamid": "76561199102932623", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 98, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1742325138}, "language": "english", "review": "yuh", "timestamp_created": 1738334449, "timestamp_updated": 1738334449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186824707", "author": {"steamid": "76561199752867051", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2769, "last_played": 1739611562}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD LUCK", "timestamp_created": 1738332993, "timestamp_updated": 1738332993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "129587785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014713517", "num_games_owned": 1235, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 833, "deck_playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1736693658}, "language": "english", "review": "why is the life halved and why is this the second time it happened", "timestamp_created": 1672303973, "timestamp_updated": 1738328445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186819993", "author": {"steamid": "76561199446850902", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2541, "last_played": 1738405080}, "language": "english", "review": "gameplay perfect\r\nstory great\r\ngraphics good for 2004\r\nthis is the perfect game you can play", "timestamp_created": 1738328411, "timestamp_updated": 1738328411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186819570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378674028", "num_games_owned": 1415, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2553, "last_played": 1737149431}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life 2 is quite a game and i don't know what to say about it other than its a personal favourite.

The story needs finishing and has spent way to long without any news at all about its future and will be in limbo for some time.\r\n\r\nThe game without a doubt in my mind is the best in the series and one of my favourites.

Then something clicked, and at the end, i really enjoyed it. With HL2 things are different, there sure are parts/chapters that I would call outdated and even boring, but there are also parts where I was at the edge of my seat. It has a groundbreaking gameplay that, today, although it seems lacking, makes it even more interesting to see how Valve worked around it to make progress flow. Story wise, its pretty damn good, obviously. Not really innovative (even considering when it was released) but definitely not dumb. Although, dialogue wise... I really disliked it. It is undeniably cheesy and corny, sometimes I wondered if it was on porpuse. And again, I dont think it has that much to do with being a game developed in the early 2000s. HL2 released the same year as GTA: SA, Fable and Halo 2, games with great dialogue and honestly, not that ahead of their time. \nHalf-Life 2 delivers what it wants to deliver, great story telling with fun and, mainly at the time (sometimes even today) incredible puzzles. But yes, it has its flaws. Maybe I'm too incompetent but I got stuck at many parts not knowing where to go and honestly games should count on that (not saying they needed yellow paint at all). And the dialogue sure is cheesy, but I would never ever say to not play on this game. I could also talk about how I didn't enjoy episode 1 and loved everything about episode 2 but you should see it for yourself. Its Half-Life. Of course I recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1738304198, "timestamp_updated": 1738304198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186800471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422418740", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2077, "last_played": 1738619299}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm enjoying this game for the second time.

"english", "review": "A monumental game in my gaming career, Half-Life 2 was that defining experience that made me realise I was in for something next level. For the first time i picked it up on The Orange Box in 2008, and from the moment I booted it up, I knew I was in for a wild ride. It wasn\u2019t just a game\u2014it was an event. The environments were absolutely massive, the atmosphere was unreal, and the soundtrack? Edgy as hell. Every moment felt like a cinematic journey.\n\nIn Half-Life 2, you play as Gordon Freeman, arguably one of the most reluctant action heroes in gaming. You awaken from stasis, burdened with the trauma of the previous game, and are immediately thrust into action as the figurehead of an uprising. This isn\u2019t a simple revolution\u2014it\u2019s a battle against a multiversal alien threat, shrouded in dystopian themes and orchestrated by secretive organizations manipulating events behind the scenes.\n\nSet in a world dominated by the Combine, an alien regime that combines interdimensional authoritarianism with advanced technology, you must navigate a planet under their control. Armed with little more than a crowbar and your signature nonverbalism, Gordon becomes the key figure in the resistance. As you progress, you'll engage in intense combat, solve puzzles, explore diverse environments, and uncover the unsettling truth that nothing in this world is as it seems.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about The G-Man\u2014a mysterious, interdimensional CIA glowman who pops up like a bad dream and probably controls the entire charade like a cosmic puppeteer. Is he good? Is he bad? Is he just playing the long game? Who knows, but he\u2019s definitely got his hand in everything, watching Gordon like a hawk, pulling strings like an invisible god. \n\nYou\u2019d think it\u2019s just a sci-fi conspiracy, but after a while, you start questioning if anyone really knows what the hell is going on. Does G-Man even have a purpose, or is he just a cosmic observer who gets his kicks out of watching a man with a crowbar take on the end of the world?\n\nThe game\u2019s narrative feels like a giant puzzle, and each step forward opens up even more questions, all while you\u2019re tearing through enemy lines, trying to get answers. And the best part? It\u2019s not all about combat\u2014there are puzzles to solve, mysteries to uncover, and a sense of isolation that keeps you on edge, constantly wondering who or what will show up next. The pacing is incredible, making you feel like you\u2019re a tiny piece of something far larger, with consequences that span across dimensions.\n\nNow when the episodes are combines (haha) The user experience is smooth and now it is even moddable! 5/5", "timestamp_created": 1737481298, "timestamp_updated": 1737481298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

This installment in the Half Life series takes some of the core ideas of the first and cranks up the variety and complexity of the environments, combat, and story! My biggest praise about this game was the wonderful mix of combat scenarios: Driving sequences, point defense, squad management, stealth segments... Part of what made the first game stale was the monotony of enter room, kill enemies, repeat. This game breaks that formula. \r\n    Additionally, the work on the environments and physics in this game create such a amazing experience that still absolutely holds up.\r\nMy complaint with this game comes down to the story and ending, which I felt did not satisfy me after finishing the core game. The ending seemed two-dimensional and un-interesting compared to the bizarre and crazy twist of the first game. It could be argued that this furthers the idea of you simply being an agent of a greater force, but it was disappointing for me.\r\n\r\nImagine my surprise then when the first extra story chapter opens with the very twist I was missing! The two story extensions are absolutely must-plays alongside the main game, and the second chapter was honestly my favorite content of the whole installment. \r\nVery impressed with this game and had a great time.

With news of his return spreading amongst a fledgling resistance movement headed by former allies, Gordon finds himself on an impossible journey across barren canals and crumbling coastlines in a desperate attempt to liberate the planet from alien control.\n\nContaining realistic & innovative physics; gorgeously rendered environments that still look beautiful even today; a haunting

It\u2019s been almost 20 years, yet you launch it and instantly realize: this shit still holds you by the soul. From the first minute, you get sucked into this bleak, ruined world. City 17, those panel buildings, the creepy announcer\u2019s voice, the oppressed people \u2014 the atmosphere is so damn good that it gives you chills.\n\nThe gameplay \u2014 holy shit. The gravity gun is, motherfucker, the coolest tool in shooters. You\u2019re not just shooting like usual, you\u2019re actually interacting with the world. You catch saw blades, throw them at zombies, move barrels with gasoline, blow shit up. And it works so damn well that you want to try it again and again.\n\nThe story? Well, that\u2019s top notch too. Basically, you\u2019re alone against the whole damn system. Gordon\u2019s silent but such a badass hero you actually want to play him. Alyx? Just amazing. Not just a \u201ccompanion\u201d following you around, but a character who genuinely makes you feel something. Her jokes, her concern, her reactions \u2014 it makes her real.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest, there are some downsides. Sometimes you just want to yell at the game: \u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d Enemies sometimes act dumb. Companions, when they get stuck in narrow spaces, start blocking you and pissing you off. Also, the story is a bit too linear at times. You go exactly where you\u2019re told and nowhere else.\n\nBut you know what? I don\u2019t give a fuck because this game is damn amazing. Even the graphics, which are technically outdated, still look great because of the detailed design.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019d recommend this game to anyone who hasn\u2019t played it yet. This isn\u2019t just a game, it\u2019s motherfucking history. Yeah, it\u2019s old, but if you\u2019re down for a couple of nights immersed in real classic, you won\u2019t regret it.

Karakternya sangat ikonik, seperti gordon freeman, alyx, g-man, dll\r\n\r\nSerius, kalian wajib main game ini setidaknya untuk 1x seumur hidup\r\n\r\nOm Gaben, Half-life 3 kapan keluar? Aku penasaran kelanjutan dari half-life 2 episode 2\r\n\r\nSekian dari saya, terima kasih.

Despite being made and released well over two decades ago it still serves as the gold standard in the genre it helped define. To state that it was just an amazing shooter would undermine how influential and genre defining HL2 is, paving the way for extensive mods, engine evolution, and raising the bar astronomically high in game design quality.\n\nThis game released when I was two years old. Fast forward 8 years later I had access to my mom's little Toshiba laptop, watching  videos about Team Fortress 2 characters making funny faces and saying sentence mixed swears. Despite early internet access woes, I was introduced to Valve's games and storefront with a want to play the funny ragdoll game. Half-Life 2 instantly hooked me, guiding me along one of my first experiences with a proper FPS Action-Adventure game. Throughout the years I replayed it along with the episodes, gaining more and more appreciation for the franchise as I slowly age and develop my frontal lobe.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet, I strongly recommend giving it a try. What you will find is an FPS with a mastery in pacing and progression as you play. Valve are experts when it comes to introducing mechanics and expanding on them, making sure each section of the game looks, sounds, and plays differently.

I understand why so many people love this game now, and I genuinely think everyone should atleast try this game out to see how fun it is. I have never played another linear game that has made me feel so free to make my own choices, and I have always loved games without ADS because I'm not a big fan of precise aiming.\nPersonally, I still enjoy Half-Life 1 more than Half-Life 2, and while I know it's an unpopular opinion, I would still pick both the gameplay and story of 1 over 2. I didn't find myself all too interested in the story even when paying as much attention to the characters as I could, and I liked the more arcade-like feel of Half-Life 1's gameplay, it felt like I had a bigger impact. I played Half-Life 1 for the first time around 1-2 year(s) ago, so this isn't a nostalgia thing. I'm still VERY excited to play Half-Life: Alyx, and I think Half-Life will remain one of my favorite games for a very long time. Hope to see what Valve did to patch up the cliffhanger.\n------\nOverall Review: Play Half-Life 1 first!

Say what you will about the now-horrid JK Rowling, but at the very least when she was raking in Hollywood checks she still finished it. Same with Robert Jordan, you think a mere case of death is going to stop him from completing the wheel of time? Think again! I regret reading the Song of Ice and Fire books and I regret playing the Half Life games for the same reason. It\u2019s not like Valve is a struggling indie developer crowdfunding its ambitious immersive sci fi series, either. It\u2019s one of the biggest and most successful game companies to date, and there is no reason, neither time, resources, nor demand, for such a delay in wrapping up this story, which is at the time of writing now more than twenty years old, with only two half-assed episodes and a VR exclusive non-conclusion to show for it.

I'm just not that big an FPS guy, but this is probably a must play if you like gaming in general. It has a great story with scary and heartfelt moments alike; really enjoyable game-play with cool weapons, vehicles,  and game mechanics; interesting progression with intense battles and fun puzzles; even the sound and graphics still hold up. I really liked that the game doesn't really hold your hand at any points, I got stuck on some battles and puzzles for varying amounts of time to the point of mild frustration, but in a way it adds to the overall experience and enjoyment for me.

This includes Episodes 1 & 2.\n\nI'm not much of a Half Life guy. There are bits and pieces that I enjoy, but those are just segments to a greater whole. Though, despite this, I can still see exactly why it's so loved. And it does deserve that love. \n\nHalf Life 2 is a significantly expanded upon concept that grows better with each installment. Going from the base release to the end of Episode 2. The gameplay remains the same throughout each episode with some variation here and there for puzzles or long segments. This gameplay didn't grab me all that much, but to a kid back in the early 2000's, this would've been the next level of gaming. \n\nHalf Life 2 is an incredibly competent shooter. It knows its genre and its previous title well. What Valve has always done best at, is innovation. Trying new things at every turn to improve the gaming landscape as a whole. Their work here has founded so much for the medium of gaming. I counted as I played all the thing that I've seen adapted into other projects. All the moments that inspired other games and the people who made them. There are numerous Half Life mods, but even more games inspired by it. That is something that I would consider \"industry leading.\"\n\nBase HL2 is a bit choppy at times. It's not perfect but it doesn't need to be. There are slower and faster moments, though the game does hold a fairly consistent pace. I rarely got lost or was confused about how to do something, and I had a lot of fun messing around with things like the gravity gun. Like many things made in Source, HL2 is a pretty substantial sandbox. Though I say that in pretty loose terms. There are a lot of ways of handling a situation, and each is super fun to execute. Chapters like Nova Prospekt are great for this because of how condensed the areas are. Forcing you to think more about your surroundings and what strategies you can apply to come out victorious. \n\nBase HL2 ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, just like all the episodes. This is probably the greatest folly of the whole series. An ending without a full conclusion, questions left unanswered, more to be discovered, and more. But never, ever is there another game. At least not a third. Even now, around twenty years later, we still don't know what has happened after Episode 2.\n\nHL2 is what you'd expect from a twenty year old shooter for PC's. It's old, dated, and struggles at times. Source is a great engine, until it isn't anymore. I think that's something most if not all of us know. You may find bugs or glitches in your play-through. I found minimal in mine, but I'd consider that lucky for me. I usually get hit with every bug known to man when playing any game. It's levels are fun to explore, at least for the most part. The tactics it uses against you are creative and fun to figure out. The gun play is pretty rewarding, not the best I've played with, but great for the time it released in. \n\nEpisode 1 and 2 are both great, but Episode 2 for me was the far better one. Ep 1 was good, but it had far more moments that dragged. Specifically the part where you escort citizens. It isn't hard, but it is pretty boring and drags onward. That's true for a bit of HL2. There are many segments that go on for far longer than is necessary. Making it feel like your time is being wasted, instead of letting you have fun. \n\nEpisode 2 had far fewer of these moments and in general just had more interesting environments and game play. It's chapters were more memorable and my only gripe is just how long I spent in a vehicle after the halfway mark of the episode. it does have a rather annoying hold out section at the end, but it isn't anything that is too absurd or frustrating to deal with. The one thing I hated the most from the base game was kinda fixed here too. The auxiliary power to your HEV suit gets drained when sprinting, swimming, and having your flashlight on. This makes it so that running in dark spaces with the light on drains both faster. Meaning less speed, and no vision. It's really annoying and was only mended in this chapter when the flashlight became its own thing.\n\nAll in all, these are a great look back at the earlier days of Valve as a game dev studio. They are also great shooters to play in general. Telling a captivating story while allowing you to have so much fun playing the game itself. I recommend this to pretty much anyone who likes shooters or has any interest in the Half Life universe. It's also not a bad one to get on sale as it often goes on sale for ridiculously low prices. I'd say it's a great time to grab it too as the 20th anniversary update finally consolidated all the episodes into one clean install.", "timestamp_created": 1736119558, "timestamp_updated": 1736119558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184881238", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015928678", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1305, "last_played": 1739738050}, "language": "english", "review": "such a good game that still has respectable graphics for 2025. runs like a beauty even if you have a crap PC like I do. lore wise, the game is also pretty good and doesn't leave much mystery into why things happen, but it can get confusing sometimes.\r\n\r\neverything about this game is excellent, if it goes at discount, i recommend you buy it. they have also added workshop support, so even if you finish the game, you can still have fun with community made mods that can surely entertain you for a good while.\r\n\r\n10 / 10, still in shock this was made in 2004.", "timestamp_created": 1736118823, "timestamp_updated": 1736118823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184880909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031163549", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1028, "last_played": 1737244714}, "language": "english", "review": "f", "timestamp_created": 1736118497, "timestamp_updated": 1736118497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184878630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055389412", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1736802678}, "language": "english", "review": "I strongly believe HL2 (including the episodes) is one of the best games, if not the best game ever made.

sure, But Dark Souls 2 is a far more intricate and demanding game, offering a world that is both beautiful and brutal, where every challenge tests your patience, skill, and perseverance. The combat is more strategic and rewarding, and the sense of accomplishment after overcoming the game's difficult trials is unmatched. The interconnected world design, cryptic lore, and the ever-present tension of the game's difficulty create an atmosphere that leaves a lasting impact. Unlike Half-Life 2, which can feel linear and constrained, Dark Souls 2 provides a vast, open world that encourages exploration and mastery. The design of Dark Souls 2 goes beyond just gameplay; it offers a life-changing experience that reshapes your understanding of what gaming can achieve. While Half-Life 2 is a great game in its own right, Dark Souls 2's depth, emotional engagement, and sheer brilliance make it an obvious choice for anyone seeking a more profound and transformative experience.", "timestamp_created": 1736092200, "timestamp_updated": 1736092200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

I understand that you are a busy person and have a lot on your plate \u2014 a multi-billion dollar company, hundreds of employees, millions of players using Steam. But I decided to write to you because my dream is too big to keep quiet about it.\n\nI'm an adult now, and frankly speaking, I stopped believing in miracles long ago. But there is one thing that will make me believe in magic again. It's Half-Life 3. Yes, I know it sounds like a joke, but I'm serious. I'm ready to do anything to make this game a reality. I'm even willing to carry that damned gnome from the second episode through all the levels every year if it helps (you actually made me do it twice, by the way). Imagine that? I will carry him like a cross. Again and again, dragging him through the Victory Mine and riding in a car (I won't even complain that he falls out AT EVERY TURN) just so you help me with this dream.\n\nI understand that it is not easy to develop a new game in the Half-Life universe. It's a whole universe that fans have been waiting for so many years. But if anyone can do it, it's you, Mr. Newell.\n\nIf it's hard to develop a new Half-Life, then maybe you should contact Aperture Science and make a portal that will lead us to an alternate reality where Half-Life 3 has already been released?\n\nAnyway, I believe in you. And if you can make this miracle happen, I'm sure millions of HL universe fans will be absolutely happy. And if I need to carry the gnome, I'm ready. Every year. No question.[/i]\n\n[b]With best regards,\nSergio[/b]\n\n[i]P.S. If developing Half-Life 3 turns out to be too difficult, I wouldn't mind Portal 3 either.

Players step into the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a physicist thrust into a dystopian world where the alien Combine species have devastated Earth, leaving humanity struggling to survive in the aftermath of their invasion. From the opening moments, Half-Life 2 immerses players in a richly detailed environment, where the ruins of City 17 and the desolate landscapes hint at the broader narrative. The world feels alive, with NPCs that dynamically react to the player and their surroundings, creating a sense of depth and realism, while the expertly woven narrative unfolds organically through gameplay rather than relying on cutscenes. Each new area presents distinct challenges, ranging from physics-based puzzles to intense combat encounters, all seamlessly tied to the story, ensuring every moment feels essential to the progression of the plot. This seamless blend of narrative and gameplay creates an experience that remains as compelling today as it was upon release, especially during the Half-Life 2 20th-anniversary update that vastly improves the game.\n\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One and Half-Life 2: Episode Two expand the game's universe, offering thrilling new challenges and a deeper exploration of its characters, beginning with Episode One, where Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance attempt to escape the collapsing City 17 immediately after the events of Half-Life 2. In this episode, the narrative becomes more intimate, focusing on the developing relationship between Gordon and Alyx and their struggle to survive in a world overrun by the Combine. The gameplay in Episode One builds on the core mechanics of the original game, refining combat, puzzle-solving, and physics interactions, while the addition of new enemy types and the emphasis on teamwork with Alyx bring greater variety and heightened intensity to the experience. However, Episode Two is where the series truly shines, with its larger environments, enhanced AI, and innovative vehicle mechanics providing a fresh sense of scale and freedom. Episode Two takes the experience to new heights with its expansive outdoor environments and epic set pieces, delivering adrenaline-pumping action and poignant, emotional moments that strengthen the player's connection to the characters. The story in Episode Two takes bold risks, building up to an unforgettable and emotional climax that hints at the more significant conflict, making the lack of a follow-up even more frustrating.\n\nAlthough Half-Life 2 and its episodes are among the most extraordinary gaming experiences in history, their cliffhanger endings are bittersweet, with unresolved storylines that leave players yearning for the grand conclusion that never came. The fact that Valve has only expanded the series with the VR game Half-Life: Alyx has left fans in a state of suspense, with many speculating about the fate of Gordon Freeman and the ongoing battle against the Combine. Despite this, the legacy of Half-Life 2 and its episodes endures in the hearts of gamers, as the game set a new standard for storytelling and design, leaving a lasting impact evident in countless titles that followed. The game's realistic physics engine, immersive environmental storytelling, and empowering sense of player agency were groundbreaking at the time and remain influential in modern game design. If you haven't experienced this iconic series yet, now is the perfect time to dive in and discover why Half-Life 2 and its episodes remain a cornerstone of modern gaming, influencing countless titles and continuing to fascinate players. Half-Life 2 and its episodes are a testament to the incredible potential of seamlessly blending storytelling, gameplay, and technology, creating an experience that has had a lasting impact on the gaming industry.", "timestamp_created": 1733355910, "timestamp_updated": 1733355910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "181915529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060854250", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 813, "last_played": 1482256437}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly a fantastic move on Valve to combine the episodes with the base game, you love to see it.\n\nI've never been big on FPS games but Valve has such a novel way of approaching level design that they pretty much mastered by the release of Half-Life 2.

The game was a hit for fans of the original and brought some new elements and features to the battlefield. The plot takes place two decades after the black mesa incident and earth is under siege by a seemingly unstoppable alien race, the combine.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is very well paced and put together very nicely as all the others. You play as Gordon Freeman again during the aftermath of earths defeat in the Seven Hour War. Not spoiling the rest in case you haven't picked up a copy in the 10 years its existed.\n-The environment is very immersive as it is a long seamless road to the end of the game with, as the definition of seamless implies, zero cutscenes or immersion breaking interruptions.\n-The gunplay involves the same weapons from half-life with plentiful new additions such as a combine rifle and different grenades. The arsenal available is pleasently loud, very powerful feeling, and quite fun to use when eliminating the enemy as per tradition.\n-The game gives players a little down time after a while with some dialogue heavy playable \"cutscene\" like segments. Four in total.\n-New engine means new physics, and new physics means a whole new realm of puzzling to do.\n-The ending is fantastic with closing out the game but certainly could have been better.\n\nCONS: (Not even half-life is safe from sin, sorry) Please note that i am extremely aware that this game is sorta old.\n-Controls feel less floaty than half-life 1 but there's still some slip n sliding.\n-The combine is a painfully easy enemy throughout the entire game and even when their ranks change.\n-Cutscenes are replaced with you being essentially trapped in a box and forced to listen to dialogue every playthrough. There are four instances of this happening throughout the game but all are spread vastly apart from each other.\n-The games puzzles and other logic based conundrums are bonehead easy and will just seem like annoyances on successive playthroughs. Sad part being this seems to be the games only ace in the hole as it will sometimes FORCE mundane puzzles(hope you like box stacking) on the player in order to continue.\n\nThis game is about as much of a must have as the first one. I picked the entire series up in a frantic buy in a summer sale and it was worth it. The game is very replayable to me, i went through it about twice a year ever since i picked up the orange box for the xbox 360.

That just wasn't for me.\nHaving just beaten 2 (I haven't tried the episodes yet, but I will) the difference was night and day. 2 is so much better, it's not even funny.\nThere were many points in one that just felt way too unforgiving. One mistake and you were screwed unless you reloaded. \n\nI found that 2 was still very challenging but by a more proper amount. Many sections were designed way better and gave you more of a chance to experiment with your approach. I really appreciated that.\nI did find some of the later levels where you storm the citadel to be a bit frustrating, but not as much as the first game was. Certain areas felt like you would take damage no matter where you took cover. Those were the moments I hated. Thankfully, they were few and far between.\n\nIf I had to give any real complaints, I found the gunplay to feel outdated (Not its fault. It's 20 years old).\nI found that a lot of weapons just didn't have that much of an impact. It felt like I could fire a shotgun point-blank at a Combine soldier's head, and he wouldn't even flinch.\nThe lack of iron sights was annoying too, especially since there were a few sections where Combine fired at you from far away and it felt like every gun just didn't have the range to be effective. To make it worse, you cannot fire your gun while using zoom, and that just seemed like a dumb design choice.\n\nThere were also certain segments where something interrupted my movement and Gordon would stop moving, even though I was holding down W. I would have to repress it to move again. It was usually when leaving the airboat, but it always bothered me when it happened.\nBut I think the main complaint I had was the squad mates in the later chapters. It was a cool idea, but the AI is too basic and I found that (with the exception of the medics) they got in my way WAY MORE than they helped. I died a few times because they blocked me from getting away from a grenade. It became easier to just send them to an area where they would get killed. That's how much they annoyed me.\n\nWith the complaints out of the way, here's what I loved:\n\n[b]EVERYTHING ELSE!!![/b]\n\nDespite my complaints about the gunplay, I still found the fights to be very adrenaline-pumping. \nDespite finding the later levels way more difficult, it gave the vibe of an uphill battle during a war, which I assume was the intent. And supercharging the gravity gun afterward? OH, how rewarding that was!\n\nAnd I really loved how the levels were designed. The physics puzzles were great. \nMy favourite levels were the airboat and buggy levels as I enjoyed feeling like I was on a road trip. There was so much to explore in those areas too.\n\nDespite my complaints that I had for Half-Life 1, I still recommended that people play through it at least once, but this game? [b]YOU BET YOUR ASS I'M RECOMMENDING IT!!![/b] \nPlay it more than once. Play it several times.

Half-Life 2's development was long, overbudget, and even had a very public leak via hackers. Ultimately, HL2 not only exceeded fan's expectations but even eclipsed what the original game accomplished. Since it's release 20 years ago, HL2's innovations remain so influential that there's scarcely been an FPS released since that hasn't taken something from this genre-defining behemoth. \n\nHaving preordered HL2 at an EB Games and played it at launch 20 years ago, it was a revelation; A game featuring a gripping narrative, accompanied by mesmerizing visuals, stunning environments, along with a dynamic and atmospheric soundtrack, offering the perfect backdrop for HL2's visceral combat, wide variety of enemies, puzzle solving, immersive physics, and level exploration. \n\nFrom the memorable opening sequence featuring the return of the series' enigmatic, G-Man delivering a now iconic speech in his cryptic cadence \"The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. So, wake up, Mister Freeman. Wake up and... smell the ashes...\" to the feverish crescendo of the game's finale, you feel as though you've lived through a memorable, Homer-esque epic. HL2 does so much and does it so well; from driving sequences, to physics puzzles, and at a pace that perfectly oscillates between quiet moments of scenic travel and exploration to unrelenting and frenetic, high-paced combat. There's never a moment where I felt disconnected from the experience. \n\nRecently, I've purchased a new 1TB OLED Steam deck and dock from Valve, and I honestly can't remember the last time I was this excited over a hardware purchase. Consequently, I've been going through my Steam Library and installing a lot of my old favorites from gaming's yesteryear. One such title being Half-Life 2. I've started a new playthrough (my most recent since 2018) and ironically on the 20th Anniversary of the game's launch. I'm currently 5.5 hours in and I feel more appreciative of this game and the time in which it is was created - long before gaming devolved into endless remakes, reboots, and becoming simple vessels for recurring revenue streams. Before microtransactions, battle passes, and cut content was sold as on disc DLC. Back before Q&A teams were made up of anonymous, unpaid internet beta testers. When Developers and Publishers couldn't afford to release a title in Alpha and fix it with \"guidance from the community\", post launch. When games were more than a series of systems designed to keep you playing because you were addicted and not because you were genuinely having fun and enjoying the experience. When the dopamine release felt genuine and not like the result of an obvious Pavlonian-esque manipulation. When gaming was wonder and escapism and not a state-funded tool for ideological indoctrination, social engineering, pandering and political activism. I miss those days.\n\nIn closing, after 20 years, HL2 has aged remarkably well. The game's dedicated community ensure that it's a title which is sure to live on and enjoyed by countless others in the future. Vavle's recent weighty 20th Anniversary update featuring bux fixes, enhancements including 3.5 hours of developer commentary and a unification of HL2 and it's two subsequent episodes.

Episode One and Two aren't just add-ons - they take everything great about the base game and push it further, especially the bond between Gordon and Alyx. I love that they got the original developers back to record commentary for the base game too. Their insights into creating City 17 and developing the physics system really show why this game was so groundbreaking.\nThey've also done a great job cleaning up the visuals - fixing those old lighting quirks, improving the shadows, and making everything work properly on modern displays. The Workshop support is the icing on the cake, opening up years of amazing community content to explore. Two decades later, Half-Life 2 isn't just preserved - it's the best it's ever been.

let's grab our crowbars and revisit a classic with a review of Half-Life 2!\n\n**The Long Play:**\n\n**Half-Life 2: A Masterclass in Game Design That Still Holds Up Today**  \u09ac\u09bf\u099c\u09cd\u099e\u09be\u09a8\n\nDeveloped by Valve and released in 2004, Half-Life 2 isn't just a game; it's a landmark achievement in the history of video games. It's a first-person shooter that set new standards for storytelling, physics, and environmental interaction, and it continues to influence game design to this day.\n\n**A Story Told Through the World:**\n\nHalf-Life 2 masterfully tells its story through environmental storytelling and subtle details rather than relying on lengthy cutscenes. You play as Gordon Freeman, the silent protagonist from the first game, who awakens in City 17, a dystopian metropolis under the oppressive rule of the Combine, an alien empire.  The world itself tells the story of the invasion and its impact on humanity.\n\n**The Gravity Gun: A Revolution in Gameplay:**\n\nThe introduction of the Gravity Gun was a revolutionary moment in gaming. This iconic weapon allows you to manipulate objects in the environment, turning everyday items into weapons or tools for solving puzzles. It's an incredibly versatile tool that adds a layer of depth and interactivity to the gameplay that was unheard of at the time.\n\n**Pacing and Variety That Keeps You Hooked:**\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a masterclass in pacing and variety. The game seamlessly blends intense action sequences with exploration, puzzle-solving, and moments of quiet reflection. You'll be fighting Combine soldiers one moment, navigating treacherous environments the next, and then solving physics-based puzzles to progress. The game constantly introduces new mechanics and challenges, keeping you engaged from beginning to end.\n\n**A World That Feels Alive:**\n\nCity 17 and its surrounding environments feel incredibly alive and believable, thanks to the game's advanced (for its time) physics and AI.  Enemies react intelligently to your actions, and the world around you feels dynamic and responsive. The facial animations, while dated by today's standards, were groundbreaking at the time and added a level of emotional depth to the characters.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n*   Revolutionary physics-based gameplay with the iconic Gravity Gun \ud83e\uddf2\n*   Masterful environmental storytelling that immerses you in the world \ud83d\udcd6\n*   Perfect pacing and variety that keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n*   A believable and atmospheric world with impressive (for its time) AI and physics \ud83c\udf0e\n*   Memorable characters and a compelling, if subtly told, narrative  \u09ac\u09bf\u099c\u09cd\u099e\u09be\u09a8\n\n**Cons:**\n\n*   Graphics are dated by today's standards (though still impressive for their time) \ud83d\udc7e\n*   Some may find the silent protagonist approach to storytelling less engaging \ud83e\udd2b\n\n**Overall: 10/10** - Half-Life 2 is a masterpiece of game design. It's a landmark title that revolutionized the first-person shooter genre and continues to influence game developers today. Its innovative gameplay, compelling story, and immersive world make it a must-play for any gamer, even today. It is a timeless classic that has earned its place in video game history.\n\n***\n\n*Disclaimer: This review was generated by an AI (hello again!), and while I haven't *played* the game in the traditional sense, I have access to and have processed an immense amount of information about it, including reviews, gameplay videos, and critical analyses.* \ud83e\udd16\n\n**The Short Play:**\n\nHalf-Life 2:  Revolutionary FPS, still amazing! Best: Gravity Gun, immersive world, pacing. \ud83e\uddf2\ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Worst:  Graphics show their age.

about the \"masterpiece\" of HL2 (2004, not a modern one), like a litmus test, showed how poorly the average user thinks and how easy it is to make \"everyone recognized 10/10\" out of nothing.

Also, Helicopter Bosses with infinite mines, oppressive one-hole gameplay in vehicle missions and hordes of useless friendly NPCs from the CallOfDuty circus.  \n\n* Manhack drones in collectors ARE EXTREMELY GOOD. Headcrab Shells on civilians ARE DRAMATICALLY good. The tunnels before the Citadel don't look too bad, to be honest (better - in Episode One). \n\nPhysics - just a HAVOK-engine with issues when three bricks balance the protagonist on a swing. Puzzles are squalid in most. \nGraphics - good water, but FarCry1 is already there; not bad flames, but Unreal2 is already there; poor empty landscapes; awkward architecture with cheap textures; bad models and body-textures except for 2-3 faces; bad animations except for 2-3 faces. \nStory - the plot is not revealed, means \"mocking_disregard\"; characters are flat; feigned dialogues are just disgusting.

antlion . . . ) and every one of them have a unique gameplay experience .\n2. everything in the game has it purpose from raven home to laszlo [spoiler] the finest mind of his generation [/spoiler] nearly everything is important and cutting it will lessen the experience.\n3. it has a good foundation (likable characters, map and art design, soundtracks, smooth gameplay, interesting story )\nand i am aware of the impact that it had on gaming.\n\n[h1] Half-life 2 episode 1 [/h1]\n\nthis episode has one of the best game intros it is just heartwarming and done flawlessly\n\n[h1] Half-life 2 episode 2 [/h1]\n\n\nI love how you can see the citadel everywhere you go and how it changes with every chapter.\nand you have the gnome as much as it was annoying I enjoyed bringing him with me from the beginning of the episode to the end.\nwell made ending.\n\n[h1] half-life 2 episode 3 [/h1]\n\n\nI know that Valve doesn't want to make a new half-life until they have a revolutionized idea because that is what the series is known for and it is true every one has high expectations for it so it is impossible to satisfy all but I played the game in ( 2020 ) 16 year after it released and it still a unique game and most of the games are not at its level\ni think my first 2 points is what makes half-life ( half-life ).", "timestamp_created": 1655982032, "timestamp_updated": 1738522089,

It's easy to see why it has become a classic.\n\nThe presentation still holds up fairly well overall, but it is uneven.\n- Architecture and design of the environments are great, but the low res textures and blocky meshes shows the real age.\n- The gravity gun and all the physics puzzles are clever and fun, but there's a lot of jank when driving vehicles or interacting with squads.\n\nIt's a game that is trying to be two different things and I think it distracts.\n- I like it when it focuses on the dystopian sci-fi part. It's a well written story with very satisfying gun-play and interesting enemies that acts realistically.\n- But I don't like when it then switches over to a zombie horror survival game that focuses more on the jump scares.\n\nAnd the fact that we're never going to see Episode 3 and a conclusion to the story sucks.", "timestamp_created": 1738500995, "timestamp_updated": 1738500995, "voted_up":

Even years after its release, it remains a benchmark for storytelling, world-building, and gameplay in first-person shooters. [/b]\n\n[h3] Pros: [/h3]\n\n[b] 1. Unparalleled Atmosphere [/b]\nThe oppressive, dystopian world of City 17 feels alive with its eerie silence, haunting Combine architecture, and subtle environmental storytelling. Every area tells a story, pulling you deeper into its universe.\n\n[b] 2. Revolutionary Physics and Gameplay [/b]\nThe Source engine was a marvel for its time, and its physics are still satisfying today. The Gravity Gun is a standout, making combat and puzzles incredibly engaging. No other game blends action and brain-teasing challenges so seamlessly.\n\n[b] 3. Flawless Level Design [/b]\nFrom the creepy, zombie-infested streets of Ravenholm to the sprawling sand dunes of Highway 17, every location feels distinct. The pacing is perfect, keeping you engaged with just the right balance of action, exploration, and quiet tension.\n\n[b] 4. Engaging Storytelling [/b]\nDialogue and plot unfold naturally, leaving you to connect the dots. Gordon Freeman\u2019s silence lets you feel like the protagonist without forcing unnecessary exposition.\n\n[b] 5. Timeless Combat [/b]\nThe weapon variety is excellent, from the iconic crowbar to the pulse rifle. Combine soldiers and alien creatures are smartly designed enemies that keep fights interesting and satisfying.\n\n[b] 6. Modding Community [/b]\nEven after finishing the main game, the modding scene keeps the adventure alive. Fan-made stories, tweaks, and expansions offer endless replayability.\n\n[h3] Cons: [/h3]\n\nHonestly, finding negatives in Half-Life 2 is a challenge. If we\u2019re nitpicking:\n\n- The vehicle segments might feel slightly long for some players, but they break up the action nicely.\n- Graphics, while still impressive for their time, show their age in certain textures and animations.\n\n[i] Half-Life 2 isn\u2019t just a must-play\u2014it\u2019s a must-experience. Every element, from the story to the gameplay, feels like it was crafted with care and innovation. It\u2019s a timeless gem that every gamer should have in their library.

I feel fortunate to have experienced the games before it and not being able to find their equal many years later.\n\nCatacombs and Wolfenstein 3D and then the revolutionary Doom. Quake and Decent after and so many clones of these games I ended up being exhausted and tired of the whole FPS genre altogether.\n\nDark Forces:Jedi Knight restored my faith breathing new life into playing a FPS having force powers, cooler guns and weapons, npc friendlies bringing life into the game that was an indication of something we would see in the future.\n\nUnreal brought intensity and fear like never before seen in a game. It was far more than we ever felt with Doom even with a sound blaster and good speakers.\n\nAnd finally Jurassic Park Trespasser. Terribly optimized and unfinished game that was an absolute bust. But the game mechanics and interaction opened the door to what became Half-Life.\n\nIt seemed like the most realistic game ever made. It was unbelievable and life like. You could do things in a video game you could not do before. Everything you saw and heard was a new experience. The future was here.\n\nHalf-Life 2 was like playing the first game all over again. It really delivered. And it\u2019s the game that when you go back and play it really hasn\u2019t lost a step. \n\nIt\u2019s really one of the last great games of its kind.

The result was an influential classic that many people consider one of the finest games of all time. Whether it's the [i]literal[/i] best game ever made is up for debate, but it's certainly up there, and is definitely worth experiencing at least once.\n\n\nTo begin with, the game has aged remarkably well. It still looks nice (the 20th anniversary update made it look better) and plays quite intuitively for a game as old as it is, with much-improved physics over the first game thanks to the Source engine. That alone was a significant advance; even if most of the game's physics puzzles were rudimentary in comparison to later games, they were groundbreaking in 2004. The inclusion of a weapon that manipulates physical objects, the gravity gun, is lauded to this day.\n\nThe actual shooting in this FPS was never revolutionary in and of itself. It's pretty old-school these days what with no aiming down sights, and it has less cool guns than HL1, but it's still fairly satisfying. Valve's masterful grasp of pacing is displayed as enjoyable shooting sections are interstitched with traveling, puzzles and plot scenes - HL2 continues the series tradition of taking place entirely from first-person perspective. One could consider some of the beginning and endgame plot sections to be glorified cutscenes anyway, but that technique is generally used sparingly enough to justify it. It's more of a problem in the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/380/]episodic[/url] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/420]sequels[/url].\n\nThe story pitting Gordon Freeman against the alien dictatorship of the Combine years after the events at Black Mesa has lost a bit of its bite, simply because of the fact it was released in 2004 and was more original back in its day. (Seinfeld has the same problem with its comedy.) The cultural problem, not the alien problem. It's still ultimately engaging; even if the mid-game drags at points, the majority of the game is smartly laid out and enjoyable, displaying considerable variety in both gameplay and tone that was revolutionary when it came out.\n\n\nIf there's criticism to be had of the story, it's that it's basically in the middle of its series. It's a continuation of Half-Life 1 that keeps going until HL2: Episode Two, which itself ends on an unresolved cliffhanger. The characters and story therefore may not be as compelling for some people if they haven't played HL1 and received the context from that game. Valve's continuing decision to eschew traditional cutscenes and give the player absolute control at all times, as well as the lack of spontaneity in combat, means that the game can get tiresome on repeat playthroughs in comparison to HL1.\n\nWhile there's also something to be said for reliving those narrative scenes after years and years of not playing, it ultimately doesn't work quite as well as a narrative vehicle here as it did in the chaotic confines of the original Half-Life, where danger was seemingly around each and every corner. Gordon Freeman as a silent protagonist also doesn't quite work as well in this game, with its individually defined, designed and voice-acted supporting characters, as it did in the original game with its masses of nameless scientists and Barneys.\n\nI'd still urge you to try this if you're a fan of shooters and you haven't already, as these criticisms are ultimately minor in the face of how good the game is overall, and of how influential it was.", "timestamp_created": 1387324545, "timestamp_updated": 1733437854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518294274806976318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "39697136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210911887", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6196, "last_played": 1734120070}, "language": "english", "review": "haf lif\n", "timestamp_created": 1517191688, "timestamp_updated": 1733437845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "181989220", "author": {"steamid": "76561199206262008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1655, "last_played": 1720664789}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1733437633, "timestamp_updated": 1733437633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "181989096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272804994", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1602, "last_played": 1733437466}, "language": "english", "review": "...time, mr.

The game mechanics aren't just able to keep up with modern standards; they are pretty much timeless.\n\nThe gunplay itself is snappy and great, reminding me of boomer shooters such as Doom and Quake. However, the true star of the show in this game is the Gravity Gun. As the main tool for solving physics-based puzzles and engaging in combat, it gives players a lot of agency in how they approach challenges.\n\nThe quick thinking enabled by the Gravity Gun in combat situations is immensely satisfying. For example, you can throw explosive barrels at aliens or zombies, cut enemies in half with launched saw blades, and more. The game ensures players are almost never out of control and allows interaction with virtually everything in the environment, making the experience highly immersive.\n\nIt does an excellent job of trusting the player to navigate situations on their own. The map design and object placement are intuitive, making it easy to figure out how to proceed without needing constant hand-holding.\n\nThe game's big strength is letting the player experience the story through exploration and action rather than overwhelming you with exposition. When there is dialogue, it is well done and short enough to let you get back to playing the game, making the story that is provided throughout the game feel more valuable.\n\nOverall:\n\nHalf-Life 2:

However you rarely get to use it much offensively since there isn't many sawblades or such objects. \nWeapons I do like are the shotgun, revolver, AR2, and crossbow since they do a lot better burst damage.\nWhile I do like being able to control the character while in cutscenes, there is no option to skip cutscenes.\nSome sections in the game last too long like the boat ride.\nYou move slower and can't airstrafe. At best your hops can launch you a little faster, but you can't chain hops into a bunnyhop.\nAnd the combine ai is a little of a downgrade when compare to hecu AI.\n\n5/10, good as a video game but disappointing as an fps game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1669402853, "timestamp_updated": 1733534228, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513888895511627197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182095343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023890046", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3109, "last_played": 1733939014}, "language": "english", "review": "what can i say about hl2 that hasnt been said\r\ngreat game", "timestamp_created": 1733534031, "timestamp_updated": 1733534031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182094874", "author": {"steamid": "76561199805947927", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1313, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1742593641}, "language": "english", "review": "best game i ever played but skibidi man is scary", "timestamp_created": 1733533543, "timestamp_updated": 1733533543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182093816", "author": {"steamid": "76561199729195239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1740964785}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1733532582, "timestamp_updated": 1733532582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182091998", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962256480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1736697331}, "language": "english", "review": "Trend setting game.

[/h1]\nOn November 16, 2004, Valve released the greatest gem ever.\n\n[h2] The Beginning [/h2]\nI used to play this game as a kid and I liked this game of how immersive it is.\n\n[h2] My Perspective [/h2]\n2 years after I had my Steam account & I bought all the Valve games on the launcher, I started playing Half-Life 2 & it still looks incredible playing this game, the soundtrack was great to listen to as well. 3 years after I finished the game, I also started playing episodic games and had the same feeling with Half-Life 2.\n\n[h3] Mods [/h3]\nI don't have any mods installed but I thought I wanted to add two mods that hooked me.\nRaising the Bar: Redux is what Half-Life 2 would be before the final release, it looked incredible and gritty!\nHalf-Life 2 VR Mod is the same as Half-Life: Alyx. Immersive, and amazing!\n\n[h3] Other [/h3]\nI made a poster of Half-Life 2 & its episodic games, and it's hung in my room to this day.\n\n[h2] Closing thoughts [/h2]\nToday, I'm writing this review for the 20-year celebration of the best game of all time! [spoiler] (and also the unfortunate 20 years after the human race lost The Seven Hour War against the Combine) [/spoiler]\n\nAnd again...\n[h1] HAPPY 20TH ANNIVERSARY HALF LIFE 2!!! [/h1]\n\n[h1] Edit: November 19, 2024 [/h1]\nAfter I wrote my review, Valve updated HL2 to celebrate its 20th anniversary.\nThe update is bigger than the Half-Life 25th anniversary update (Eg. upscaled UI, classic graphics returned, 3 games were added to the base game; like Lost Coast, and the headline, Episode 1 & Episode 2)\nI've already beaten Half-Life 2 so I'm writing this review and then I'll continue playing HL2 with Episode One & Episode Two later.\n\n[h1] Half-Life 2 [/h1]\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2]\nThe game plays like Half-Life, shoot many enemies or smack them with a crowbar as you can and get to the end/loading screen.\n\n[h2] Graphics & Quality [/h2]\nHalf-Life 2's Source Engine has more features than its predecessor, but you already know that, but if you don't then I'll explain.\nUpdated textures & environments.\nRagdoll physics.\nBetter map design.\n& realistic physics.\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\nHalf-Life 2 takes place 20 years after Half-Life 1.\nThe story is enjoyable to listen to. It's a story about loss and despair & twisting it into revolution through the gameplay!\n\n[h2] Overall [/h2]\nI'm rating this game 10/10. It's a really good deal for those who would want to play this masterpiece, but unfortunately, the game was free to play before Nov, 19, but it's still cheap to this day. I recommend this game if you like FPS and the story so far.\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to play Episode One.\n\n[h1] Edit: November 19, 2024... Again [/h1]\nHalf-Life 2: Episodes One & Two have the same gameplay & quality as HL2 but with Alyx on your side, so I'm just reviewing the story and that's it\n\n[h1] Half-Life 2: Episode One [/h1]\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\nThe story is good to listen to. You and Alyx's only objective is to evacuate everyone far away from the citadel!\n\n[h2] Overall [/h2]\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One is going to have a 9.6/10! It's the same experience as Half-Life 2's Story, & I'm still recommending this game like the predecessor.\nTwo games have been done, and now one more to go.\n\n[h1] Edit: November 20, 2024 [/h1]\n\n[h1] Half-Life 2: Episode Two [/h1]\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\nThis game's story is a heartbreaking experience I had played. [spoiler] Prepare for unforeseen consequences. [/spoiler]\n\n[h2] Overall [/h2]\nHalf-Life 2: Episode Two deserves a 9.5/10! This second episode has some mechanics that can be tedious but can be managed if you're good at this game.\n\nF@$K! I didn't know how long this review has been like holy s#!t, man! I don't know if it's the longest review mankind has made or if someone has a longest review than mine!\n\n[h1] Edit: November 27, 2024 [/h1]\nI'm editing this review for the 2024 nominee award", "timestamp_created": 1731698436, "timestamp_updated": 1733522458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182077109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109953404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1197, "last_played": 1733510533}, "language": "english", "review": "The legend.", "timestamp_created": 1733520320, "timestamp_updated": 1733520320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182076181", "author": {"steamid": "76561199249824432", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3696, "last_played": 1733519516}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the game in 2024, and to be honest its one of the best games played in a while.  9/10 for the story telling, and if you can bear with the graphics, its well worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1733519803, "timestamp_updated": 1733519803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182072718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096278482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1733518075}, "language": "english", "review": "game", "timestamp_created": 1733518103, "timestamp_updated": 1733518103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182072692", "author": {"steamid": "76561199242185008", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 406, "last_played": 1734623885}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice.

I have a mediocre computer and can get everything in 4K, 60 HZ with no hitches with a Ryzen 3700X, an RX 5700 XT Nitro plus, and have no complaints.

Half-Life 2. \nYou're on Steam. \nIf this isn't in your library, you're doing it wrong. \nShould go without saying this is another \"I fucking love this game\" badge winner. \n\nAt the time of its release, there was a lot of innovation and revolutionary game design here. The amount of objects in the world the player could interact with, and the expressions of characters, just really, really groundbreaking innovating revolutionary stuff in 2004 that blew everyone's minds away, and could really immerse you and make you feel like you're in the game world. \n\nThings like this have set the bar so high that even 20 years later, this is a much better developed & better playing game than many modern games today. \n\nOf course, it's from a different, golden age, where gaming was more stigmatized, less popular,  less of a huge industry that it is today, and game development was more centered around making the best final product possible, before 'early access' or live service games or DLC's, etc.. \n\nBut still. \n\nNow, after watching the 20th Anniversary Documentary, it's crazy to think of all the ways this game almost didn't get made or released. \n\nReasons to buy and play this game: \n\n- It easily makes lists of one of the best games ever made. What is it, something like, 39 game of the year related awards? And an original story.\nSet the bar for FPS for a generation or two. Often feels like Matrix-type action. \n\n- Update: There are a lot of great mods... the original Substance v0.84 is a diehard favorite for me, I always try to emulate the feel that weapon-set gave...but there are many great alternatives I discuss below. 'Synergy' is a good favorite option lately. \n\n- Lots of fun and amusing moments, good storytelling through a game. The level design and puzzles are really great. \n\n- Half Life 2: Update is a free mod/update for the game that works really well and has all the achievements and it really does make the graphics look a good deal better, AI seems smoother too sometimes, definitely improves the experience, making the game more immersive, and suspension of disbelief alot more tolerable, improving the story and gameplay. The lighting and reflections are great and much more realistic. \n\n- Deathmatch Tactical 1.2 is an awesome frigin' mod with the best substance weapons, and bullet time, it's freaking great, you can switch between tactical and substance modes, spawn all the weapons/ammo without using impulse_101, spawn extra enemies, sniper and crossbow have scopes, and the combine and blood effects look awesome. \n\n- Garry's Mod automatically loads Half-Life 2 maps if you have HL2 installed, so you can play through the entire campaign co-op, or with a portal gun, custom weapons, etc. etc. to your hearts content. \n\n- Cinematic Mod is another awesome mod, and all these mods have their own shortcuts by the way, meaning you can have all these versions of the game to play whenever you want and they wont interfere with each other. Cinematic mod also upgrades the graphics and changes the way the weapons look and act in some cool ways. Deathmatch Tactical and CM both have aiming down the sights for example. CM enables many changes that you can customize, including harder difficulty (always lethal headshots). \n\n- All the HL2 games and Black Mesa have good soundtracks and great memorable gameplay moments that are epic to behold the first time and subsequent times after. \n\nI definitely recommend this game. If you've never seen, heard of, or played this game, buy it and play it now!!! And I would recommend playing Half Life 2: Update!\n\nI hope my review helped inform and give ideas to others as to the best ways to experience this game of legends.", "timestamp_created": 1484291205, "timestamp_updated": 1733270565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "181755784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447215088", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10070, "last_played": 1735109337}, "language": "english", "review": "Really pleased with the recent updates to the game :)", "timestamp_created": 1733270239, "timestamp_updated": 1733270239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "181755770", "author": {"steamid": "76561199389492025", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 633, "last_played": 1735907357}, "language": "english", "review": "BEST FUCKING GAME EVER", "timestamp_created": 1733270231, "timestamp_updated": 1733270231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "181755206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022917491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2056, "last_played": 1733358796}, "language": "english", "review": "So good.

Wood never splintered in such glorious fashion, barrels never rolled like that before and the folding mattress, oh the splendour of the folding mattress... Needless to say it was something to look forward to.\n\nI played the game back then and I did it again now, 20 years later. I could remember why this was revolutionary in 2004. It had been attempted before (Trespasser, Hitman), but physics came in like a wrecking ball this time. The way you could manipulate objects was fun and new, but most importantly, the action received a facelift that kept combat fresh and exciting from start to finish.\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty which did something I don't like - it turned enemies far spongier. I don't mind that the enemies do more damage, but if my weapons are turned into peashooters, that's the wrong way to add difficulty. In an FPS, you want the guns to be punchy and powerful, so if you're reading this, do what I did. Set the difficulty to the highest, but add sk_dmg_inflict_scale3 \"5.00\" to autoexec.cfg at Half-Life 2/hl2/cfg and now the guns actually do something. Small tweak but made reliving the memories that much more fun. Game's only about 10 hours long so if you haven't had the experience, for a literal bargain you can do it now.\n\nThe ending is bad just like Xen was in Half-Life 1, but 95% of what precedes it makes it all worth it.

Half-Life 2 needs no introduction! Both it and its original first installment were revolutionary titles that showed how video games are made, how they form the design of the game to feel like a breathing real world, and how they pace themselves to create a captivating narrative filled with mystery. Half-Life walked so other games could run. There are many things from Half-Life that ended up being crucial lessons for a video game's designs, including physics and enemy behavior, which were not introduced just to be innovative but took complete advantage of to form a satisfying and engaging gameplay. The story is also well written, continuing the Lovecraftian story of the first game but combined with a classic dystopian setting inspired by the 1984 novel, but how the story is told through natural character interactions, environmental details, and the overall pacing of the game makes Half-Life's narrative gripping every single second! I recommend this game with all the trust, especially now that if you buy the game, you will get the episodes as well.

I dont wanna go on here cause itll take me to create a scroll here truly, just say the plot is simple and easy to understand while the lore is complex and fascinating. One of the best story lines in video games.\n-And finally replayability. IDK why but this game is SOO replayable, it just fails to be boring, Im not sure its because the lack of cutscenes and physics, or because its soo fun it doesnt gets old, but it doesnt get old.\n\nCons:\n-Not so friendly to people who arent used to these types of games, when I first reviewed this I yapped on how everything feels crancky and unnatrual so you can take from that\n-Shooting, is not that good, enemies have very little knockback and some weapons are quite crancky, it aint that bad tho, the weapons design is interesting tho, just quiet rough in practice.\n-And in general the combat is a little rough with hit scanners and all\n-Achievement are a pain in the ass in this game I guess\n-There are some gimmicks that work worse then others\n-HUUUUGE CLIFHANGERRRR ):\n\nJust stating there are now in one game the DLCs as well, the first dlc is a bit better then the main game while the second dlc is quite better and because they all rejoined in one game I gotta review them all thoghter overall\nHalf life 2  8.1/10 game, episode one is 8.4/10 and episode two is 8.6/10 I would say overall...\nThis pack is 8.5/10 game hands down (for me the best game ever would be 9.5/10)\nFirst time it might not be the best experience you ever had but down the road youll slowly find out that its more of a triumph then you think, truely one

Absolute player freedom.[/b]\n\n\nThis is probably the most legendary game on the platform that still holds up to this day. I could play this game over and over again. This game is as old as me.\n\n\n[h1]Positive:[/h1]\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nThe story continues. Freeman is brought back from stasis and now has to face the Combine. An alien race that came from Zen and invaded earth in just 7 hours. It's now your job to support the human resistance and kick their ass back to Zen. This is easier said than done\n\n[b]Characters:[/b]\nYou can't save earth on your own. You will meet eli vance and his daughter alyx which welcome you to help the resistance. You will be on your own most of the time but you will meet other people and groups that will help you in certain situations.\n\n[b]World:[/b]\nThe game starts out in an east european inspired place called \"city 17\". You will traverse diverent places throughout the game. Shores, tunnels and streets of city 17. You will use vehicles in certain parts. The world is filled with secret supplies only attentive players will find.\n\n[b]Physics:[/b]\nThe physics were revolutionary back then. It's still cool today. Everything is interactable and throwable. Sometimes even destructable. The ragdolls flying never gets old.\n\n[b]Player freedom:[/b]\nThe lack of cutscenes that take control away from the player is refreshing. It's up to you if you want to pay attention to the story or rather play around in the room. You can decide if you want to explore every room and house or if you just want to drive by it, potentially missing out on loot that could help you later. We all play the same game but everyone plays different.\n\n[b]Music:[/b]\nThe music is really good just like the first one. In fact, it reuses some of the tracks from the first game. I love the synth atmosphere tracks so much. It's even got some music that sounds like the 90's or 00's (because it is).\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nI did a review of the first game and criticised the graphics because of how ugly that game can look. I will say it again. I really don't care about graphics at all and I put gameplay over everything but HL1 hurt to look at im sorry. In HL2's case. I want to praise the graphics. This is hands down the best looking game from 2004. Nothing comes close to it. It's insane how good it still looks 20 years later.\n\n\n[h1]Negative:[/h1]\n\n[b]None:[/b]\nThis game is flawless. There is nothing that should be added or removed. (The MP7 sound makes my ears bleed but the game is worth it).\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nI've played this game multiple times. Vanilla and modded. I've collected all achievements and in the episodes too. This is what a real video game should be. It's a one and done experience that is so good that you want to play it over and over again.", "timestamp_created": 1740978675, "timestamp_updated": 1741223809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6,

Good? Yes, excellent level design, even though a couple (route kanal and the whole street fighting section) were rage inducing even back then. What I mostly dislike about HL2 which I have played very little compared to HL1, is that 99% of the promo material came from the beta which looked, sounded and behaved much better. I bought the game back in 2004 convinced that I would get the same atmosphere and feel of the beta, when none of that was preserved. It felt like a happy-go-lucky version of what HL2 was supposed to be, complete with memetic power and very bright skyboxes. In terms of story and pacing, what raising the bar showed was immensely more appealing,  the levels at the end of the day were the biggest offenders, incredibly less interesting to look at than the promo material. Here's generic eastern european city with some alien tech. No air exchange mega structures, no semi-fascist architecture, way less oppressive and not in line with what HL1 was going to show.\r\nAlso I will never get over how broken the Source engine was. What a mess of an engine, the stuttering, the endless loading, the crashes, HL2 on release was swiss cheese, holes upon holes for months on end. The fact that the levels do not stutter after loading in 2024 is amazing.

first weapon in the game that you get is a crowbar, which helped me out a lot the whole game, with its help you can fill up a couple of headcrabs or a gawking enemy. The arsenal is small, but quite sufficient in power. I liked, for example, to nail someone to the wall with a crossbow. And how I messed around when I came across a gravity cannon, everything flew from me to the enemies from various boxes and balloons to grenades that they threw at me, and there are also sharp discs-blades with which you could saw zombies. What also impressed me was the opportunity to set huge ants on the enemy using their queen's pheromones.\nIn general, if you have not played this game, then be sure to play it, I doubt that someone will not like it.", "timestamp_created": 1610097694, "timestamp_updated": 1735891556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578793227672576904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "123218820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198997050170", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 693, "last_played": 1675446951}, "language": "english", "review": "erm", "timestamp_created": 1664713746, "timestamp_updated": 1735889333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184605498", "author": {"steamid": "76561199197687783", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1735887933}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a bad shooter for a 20 year runner.

Players control Gordon Freeman as he joins a resistance movement to liberate the Earth from the control of a multidimensional alien empire, the Combine.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ATReviews]Follow My Review Group Here![/url]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]About[/th]\n        [th]Description[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udcbeGraphics[/td]\n        [td]Half Life 2 has really impressive graphics for its age. Environments are well designed and the atmosphere is absolutely impressive. The game looks really sharp and has incredible physics with even some destruction. The whole atmosphere is just so immersive, especially the beginning part of the game. Many sections look unique from each other and the enemies all look both terrifying, and really cool!. Character animations are honestly mind blowing for a game made in 2004. I wasn\u2019t expecting the amount of detail in the facial animations. The UI is really simple, but it works perfectly here.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83c\udfaeGameplay[/td]\n        [td]So many great things to say here. Let\u2019s start with the good points. I love how interactable the environment is. This plays a big role in puzzle solving and it delivers perfectly. Many of the puzzles are satisfying to solve and some even have rewards like ammo and health. I enjoyed every puzzle this game offered and never felt disappointed. The enemies are just incredible! You have a wide range of enemy types. You have many different soldiers to fight against with their own gadgets, and many creatures that will cause you many headaches and nightmares. The weapon variety is really good but one weapon stands above all, and that\u2019s the gravity gun! The gravity gun will play a huge role in puzzles, and can be a deadly weapon against anyone. You can hold on to almost any item in the game and shoot at anyone. Items can be barrels, cans, boxes, explosives, and much more. This gives you much freedom and makes the gameplay loop much more enjoyable. The level design is superb! Many cool locations with even some horror sections to keep the game interesting and mysterious at times. The game does have some flaws though. One big one is the movement. Sometimes objects on the ground will just stop you from moving completely. This is frustrating when you are doing a puzzle or trying to move quickly in tight areas. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but when it does it sucks. The companions you get later into the game are trash. I can\u2019t stand them with a passion. They will block you in doorways and just ride you from behind. The companions do more harm than good for the most part. I feel like I would have done better without them. Overall the game has amazing features and mechanics that were revolutionary for the time and still hold up fairly well.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udcdcStory[/td]\n        [td]The story was just fantastic! Saving the world from Aliens never really gets old. Seeing the world filled with corruption and drained of natural resources was pretty unique. You will encounter many incredible moments and some twists as well. The whole game felt like one big movie. No abrupt cutscene, just everything happening in real time. You will get immersed with the story and world of Half Life 2. A linear story, but a great story nonetheless. Can you save humanity in time? That\u2019s all up to you![/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udd5bPlaytime[/td]\n        [td]The game is around 15+ hours with good pacing. That's just the main story! You also have the amazing expansions packs to play, along with a ton of mods in the Steam Workshop! Half Life 2 has great replayability, especially with the amazing mod support.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83c\udfa7Sound[/td]\n        [td]The sound design is really good. Nothing groundbreaking, but it gets the job done. The game has some pretty good soundtracks as well. The voice acting is actually impressive. Everyone did their job so well and made many scenes both believable and movie like (especially for 2004). One issue I had was that you can increase the dialogue sound separately from the game. You can only change the game and music volume. Some sections make the dialogue really hard to hear and it was pretty frustrating.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u2757Bugs\u2757[/td]\n        [td]I haven\u2019t really had any serious bugs or issues. One minor graphical bug but that was really it. It's a Valve game so they always tend to have games with such little bugs and issues.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udd05Performance[/td]\n        [td]The performance is really good. Max settings with no issues with frame rate or stutters. The game was flawless from start to finish. I know back then this game was a chore to run, but if you have a modern rig you will be fine.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u2714\ufe0fPro\u2019s[/td]\n        [td][list]\n[*]Steam Workshop\n[*]Many cool locations\n[*]Fantastic puzzles\n[*]Amazing level design\n[*]Incredible story telling\n[*]Great attention to detail\n[*]Voice acting is really good\n[*]Fun weapons and gadgets\n[*]Amazing graphics for the time\n[*]Environmental storytelling\n[*]Many fun rewarding secrets\n[*]Gunplay is solid and responsive\n[/list]\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u274cCon\u2019s[/td]\n        [td][list]\n[*]Movement feels clunky at times\n[*]Companions are dumb and become a nuisance\n[*]Minor audio issues (reloading sound effect not working at times)\n[*]Can\u2019t increase the dialogue audio specifically (it\u2019s only game audio or music)\n[/list]\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83c\udfc6Rating[/td]\n        [td]9/10\nThis game is worth full price![/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udd17Conclusion[/td]\n        [td]Half Life 2 is well known for all the right reasons. With nonstop action and a quest to save the world, the game was just full of incredible moments and twists. This game feels so ahead of its time and I\u2019m happy to say that the hype is real here. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a 10/10 since it does have some issues and frustrations, but it\u2019s fairly close to that perfect score.

While i do like certain parts of the campaign, the overall leveldesign, as well as enemy variety is a bit lacking compared to Half Life 1. You get the last really meaningful weapon after 5 hours, and thats only half way through the game, at which point most encounters feel like you just fight the same enemies with the same weapons. The original HL mixed alien and soldiers, together with an very claustrophic envoirment. HL2 on the other hand removes more and more aliens, in the end you fight mostly combine soldiers, with maybe a few striders. Im also not very fond of the driving sections, tho i know that alot of ppl like em so i guess it was the right decision from valve to put them in here, theyre just not for me.\r\n\r\nDespite my problems with the game i still find it impossible to not recommend playing through it at least once.

I wasn't there since day one but I was ever since the Orange Box back in 2007. Honestly what's there to be said about Half Life 2 that wasn't already said? The fact that you're even here means you have at least heard of what it did for the gaming industry. I think everybody needs to play Half Life 2 at least once in their lives because this really is a game that changes your perspective on fps games and video games in general.\nOther games of the time that need to be remastered with mods or otherwise in order to be able to be played in an acceptable state nowadays. However, Half Life 2 doesn't need any of that and honestly it doesn't feel dated in any way in my eyes. That's why I always push back on the idea that it's a \"boomer shooter\". It's not a game just for the people who played it back in the day and are nostalgic about it. The added features that were added on the anniversary update, like the workshop, are the cherry on top. Yeah, the shooting and gunplay is a bit \"vanilla\" now but that's because of how monumental it was at the time which caused every future Valve fps game, and many non Valve games, to either literally build off it or copy it. \nAfter you're done with it might I recommend playing Synergy, which allows you to play the campaign online with others. Even though it wasn't build for more than one player the dumb fun you can have with it is crazy. Anyway, launch it and play as you're listening to the 2 hour documentary. \nSpeaking of which, near the end of the documentary it's finally revealed that Episode 3 was in the works only for 6 months and that Valve abandoned it to work on Left 4 Dead. It's incredibly tragic and even the devs said that this was a mistake and that they should have gone back to it. However, later on Gabe says that shipping Half Life 3 is Valve's obligation towards gamers.

It was one of my first Computer games I ever played and even today continues to amaze me with its excellent Story and Environment.... The only thing I am mad about is that I wasn't born earlier so I could enjoy this wonderfull series in the first days....... Half-Life is and will continue to be an amazing game for many years to come\n\nEdit: 10 years later i'm updating my review. I'm 24 now and Half-Life 2 continues to be one of my most favorite games of all time. I play through Half-Life 1, Half-Life 2, and the episodes each 1 or 2 times every year and they truly never get old to me. Every time I play through the games I get sucked in to the story all over again and I become obsessed until the cycle repeats again in a few months. Although I have been upset with Valve in recent years, convinced that they have lost their touch and no longer have the soul they had when making the Half-Life games, I was pleasantly surprised by the 20th Anniversary update and it made me remember how much respect I still have for them and of the countless hours of enjoyment they have given me with their games. If you have never played the games before I'm here to tell you firsthand that it isn't a game that you will want to miss and even after all of this time the graphics, gameplay, and story still hold up just as well as they did back in 2004. I can't wait to get my hands on the new release of Raising the Bar and I wish I could personally show Valve and the whole Half-Life team how much of a dedicated fan I am. Here's hoping for the future of Half-Life!

Half life chose to tell a story in a way that you rarely see games nowadays do, that being \"trying to create the illusion that you were not playing an interactive movie. and rather that you were the one in the story not your player character. How does it achieve that? Well first off Gordon Freeman is entirely silent and there are no cut-scenes. If Gordon wasn't silent then his opinions might differ from yours and take you out of your immersion and the lack of cutscenes makes it feel like actual real time events and not simply a before stated \"interactive movie.\" If a character is talking you don't feel like their talking to Gordon you feel like their talking to YOU, and you will often find yourself talking back to characters which makes you connect with them more. That might sound a little embarissing but it really helps to make the experiance much more enjoyable.\n\nI will probably add more to this review but I'm tired so goodbye.", "timestamp_created": 1722389202, "timestamp_updated": 1733099144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186716250", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199111861", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 374, "playtime_at_review": 1893, "last_played": 1742593572}, "language": "english", "review": "best 2004 game ever to this day\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1738203078, "timestamp_updated": 1738203078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186714232", "author": {"steamid": "76561199132697855", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1740881288}, "language": "english", "review": "Freeman", "timestamp_created": 1738200262, "timestamp_updated": 1738200262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186711080", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111456640", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 152, "last_played": 1741415228}, "language": "english", "review": "Crowbar 2", "timestamp_created": 1738195792, "timestamp_updated": 1738195792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "186710490", "author": {"steamid": "76561199809461548", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1783, "deck_playtime_at_review": 1783, "last_played": 1739041863}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic game, still enjoyable after all these years.", "timestamp_created": 1738194938, "timestamp_updated": 1738194938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, {"recommendationid": "186710307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049943111", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1623, "last_played": 1740060068}, "language": "english", "review": "A gem of a game despite its age.

I mean, where else can you solve puzzles by launching furniture, shoot a gravity gun at a bunch of exploding barrels, and have it all make perfect sense? From the moment you step into the boots of Gordon Freeman, the quietest hero in gaming history (who still manages to save the world, without saying a single word), you\u2019re hooked. The game\u2019s world is beautifully crafted, and you can\u2019t help but laugh when you accidentally launch a couch at an enemy, sending them flying like they just got hit by a truck. It\u2019s physics-based chaos, and I\u2019m here for it. And let\u2019s not even get started on the zombies\u2014because what would a post-apocalyptic world be without them, right? These zombies don\u2019t just shuffle around aimlessly; they make you question your entire existence as you try to outsmart them.\n\nAt its core, Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter set in a dystopian world where you, as Gordon Freeman, have to fight off alien invaders, a brutal totalitarian regime, and, of course, hordes of terrifying zombies. The game introduces a fascinating mix of intense combat, problem-solving, and exploration. What sets it apart from most shooters is the inclusion of the gravity gun, which lets you pick up, throw, and manipulate objects in the environment\u2014turning anything from a box of nails to a vending machine into a weapon. The physics engine is a game-changer, allowing for creative solutions to problems, whether it\u2019s building a bridge out of debris or solving environmental puzzles. The story is rich, with a deep narrative that gradually reveals the secrets of the mysterious Combine forces that have taken over Earth. It\u2019s an unforgettable experience that is immersive, suspenseful, and\u2014most importantly\u2014fun.\n\nBut what really makes Half-Life 2 stand the test of time is its unmatched atmosphere. The game is visually stunning for its age, with environments that range from eerie, fog-filled canals to the grim, industrialized city of City 17. The sense of isolation and oppression is palpable, and you can feel the weight of Freeman\u2019s journey as you fight through level after level. The AI is surprisingly advanced for its time, and it\u2019s not just about blasting your way through enemies\u2014strategizing with the environment and using your resources wisely is key.

released in 2004 I just have the opportunity to play it for first time. And I was really surprised that this game for me is not that old, in fact I think some feature are still new even for now. It answered many question for me when I was young that why it is one of the greatest game of all time. \n\nThe game has a unique way to presented the dystopia world to the player. They show you what a world would look like if the alien that really powerful have arrived by kicked you into the middle of chaos situation in City-17. Behind every action form every character in this game have a reason and consequence. And it also for the player too. \n\nHalf-Life 2 gameplay have no minimap, no cut scene, no guideline or objective...and also no bitches. You need to explore the map, learn mechanic in game especially the physic which is the main gameplay, listen to the hint that hide in conversation between you and the NPC and decide your own way go through the game. Every moment or situation that happened in game will let you join and your action will effected to them too.\n\nMobs and enemies in this game also very challenge when you have to face it. The soldier or combine have a tactics to get over you. they can learn your action and adapt to use it against player. The alien or zombies also have it's own mechanic. So you need to learn their strengths and weaknesses, and use the right weapon to fight them more effective. Physic in game also related to the mobs, if you learn to use it will make gameplay more fun and challenge. If you play like no thought-head empty, these mobs can easily get you annoyed or triggered (cuz i tried it before).\n\nHalf-Life 2 Graphic, atmosphere and sceneries are very majestic even some features are outdated now but with a game which is 20 years old now (it's even older than me) for me it not that bad compare to it time. The sound design, mood, music, dialogues are in line with the theme of the game. It can explain to you what is happened in that places and how do you get involved with it without a single word. It's make player felt like they're a part of the game.\n\nAfter all the reason, for me Half-Life 2 is worth to play once in your lifetime. even it also have a bad sides such as some bugs that can ruined the game and because it's an old game some feature are not up to date. Also with design game with no guideline or anything that can lead you to the next path sometime can make you stuck in the scene or place for a while and easily get you bored (especially me who don't understand English much because it's not my native language cause me to walk around and don't know which way to go) but all in all is a very great game for me. Worth my expectation as one of the great FPS game of all time as people said, even 20 year have already passed and since I've Known the game name Half-Life 2.", "timestamp_created": 1735827000, "timestamp_updated": 1735827000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "168878985", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095215215", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1197, "last_played": 1733636365}, "language": "english", "review": "I now have full life", "timestamp_created": 1720012783, "timestamp_updated": 1735824601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184528678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279101242", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1740508510}, "language": "english", "review": "HEHE", "timestamp_created": 1735823816, "timestamp_updated": 1735823816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184526127", "author": {"steamid": "76561199814434020", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1737163874}, "language": "english", "review": "Half life 2 is peak, especially with mods (great gameplay and story, but I havent finished the story yet)", "timestamp_created": 1735821624, "timestamp_updated": 1735821624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184526126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291152846", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1741621686}, "language": "english", "review": "All timer", "timestamp_created": 1735821623, "timestamp_updated": 1735821623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184525328", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986229632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2319, "last_played": 1736323051}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1735820917, "timestamp_updated": 1735820917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "184523917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043927443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1176, "last_played": 1735979787}, "language": "english", "review": "Anniversary update is great.

A must have game even.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a beautiful game and is put together wonderfully, yes there is some bumps in the road while playing with some chapters but it is still great fun to play. \n\nAfter finally playing both HL2, HL2E1, and HL2E2. There are a lot of things I gotta say.\n\nHalf-Life 2;\n\nThe great:\nI love how that a ton of the places you go to in HL2 feel well developed and alive, there's a lot of things to look at and find, this which helps the gameplay as if you care for just going in one path quickly, you can! But if you want to take it slow and explore, you are allowed to do that too! There's a lot of things for anything to enjoy!\n\nThe meh:\nWhile yes I did just say how good the gameplay is there is some areas that just give a, ugh, feeling while coming back to them. In example: Some of Water Hazard and Highway 17 are a little boring to play but those boring parts go by quickly so it's not that bad.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is overall for me a beautiful: 10/10\n\n\nAfter the success of HL2, Valve created Episode 1, which tells more of the story about what happens after the ending of HL2.\n\nThe Great: \nDespite this game being quite short, it still is good. I love the way the have you co-op with Alyx and how much they do well with that idea. The final area is also really fun and also it has the best joke in the whole Half-Life series. Zombine.\n\nThe Meh:\nHonestly, I did not have any bad to say about EP.1.\n\nHalf-Life 2: EP.1 is overall, once again, for me is: 10/10\n\n\nYou know what's next, EP.2\n\nThe Great:\nThe big thing about this expansion is that you get to travel with Alyx and get to launch a rocket. This game is also honestly quite fun. I love that is now is wanting you to do more exploring type gameplay then combat. That doesnt mean its all explorer type gameplay. When there is big combat sections it's awesome here.\n\nThe Meh:\nThe 'Get Some Grub' Achievement is quite annoying but that's all I have to say about EP.2\n\nHalf-Life 2: EP.2: 10/10\n\n\nThe whole HL2 trilogy is wonderful and there will never be a EP.3.

1 is focused on survival, while the second episode adds mostly to the story leading to what is known as one of the biggest cliffhangers of history, since we will never get to see a

Many years ago on the Xbox 360 I played all the Half-life 2 games well over 10  times and  got  100% of achievements. Now, on this busted up computer that stutters sound and visual every 2 minutes, I have 100% on too. It's that great of a series that persevered through the bullshit of my machine not working so I could gain all the achievements. Because  I love this game so much. It's an almost perfect game and sequel to me  and now you get it and the episodes all in one purchase  outside of the orange box.\r\n\r\nI'm not really writing this review to sell you on Half-life 2. It's more so for me. Everybody knows the Half-life series is incredible already. The only reason someone is reading this is because they love these games too and want to see that admiration in others. \r\n\r\nWhat I love about Half-life 2 is that it takes the way the first game presented storytelling and  only  amplified it. No cutscenes except for the scenes  with Gman and when you meet Alyx for the first time. Both of which, do not take up enough time to make you think \"Just let me play\". The story is always happening around you in gameplay and I love that. There's no point at which they tell you that Striders are not just robots with mounted guns, they're bio-mechanical. The game always shows you. It shows you the hairs on their legs and the brain that falls out of one in episode 2. Not the best example in the world, but the game is full of better ones. \r\n\r\nI know that in Half-life 2 it's almost like retconning. Yes, Breen, you remember your director, right Gordon? Oh, and Kleiner and Eli and don't forget Magnusson. He still doesn't forgive you for that Casserole incident. That last one is actually pretty good because it remembers that you remember having the choice in the first game to do that, and you probably did. It's a cool nod. But I understand if in 2004 someone who played the first game was just confused about who all these people are. I think despite them not really being defined characters or characters at all in the first game, I really think their addition in the sequel makes the story. I love every single one of them. Even Magnusson by the end of episode 2. \r\n\r\nBarney, Keliner, Alyx, Eli, Dog... They all give you a reason to truly care about what you are doing in the story. Without any of these characters you probably wouldn't care that much and I think Half-life 2 would be considered generally a bit worse than the original. Half-life 1 was a lot better in gameplay in my opinion. The AI of the marines is second to none. The combine can't really compete with them in gameplay. But they do in terms of visual design and story. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay is fantastic still in this game, even if it doesn't quite compare to its ancestor. Half-life 1 gave you such an array of unique weapons that throughout the whole game still served a purpose. In Half-life 2, for the most part, there's at least 2 weapons that go obsolete. The crowbar and the first assault rifle.  There's no need for the crow bar once you get the gravity gun and the only reason you would use the assault rifle over the pulse rifle would be to use the grenade alt fire. \r\n\r\nMoreover, I do sort of miss the cool and crazy alien and scientific weapons in the first game, though I completely understand for story purposes why those are not there. Plus, I think the gravity gun completely makes up for it and bug bait is cool for nova prospekt. \r\n\r\nAlso on gameplay, people seem to think that the enemy variety in the first game beats out the enemy variety in the second. I can understand that completely. I do wonder where the Houndais and the Bull squids went. But I think the combine, despite being a tad too easy to fight compared to marines, are a fantastic representation of what society is now. They help emphasise the hopeless dystopia that humanity is in now due to the 7 hour war. They are faceless people who beat and kill other humans because that's the most power you can obtain as a human in this society. At least the combine soldiers are... Probably should have said that first. Of course, the combine as a whole are aliens that go to planets, drain their resources and take parts of their technology and adapt it to themselves. They are universal colonisers. \r\n\r\nAmong the combine there's also some other interesting enemies such as the ant lions, their acid spitting cousins, their rhino looking mothers, the new varieties of head crabs that result in different effects to you as well as different transformations, the hunters, the gunships and the striders. I'm sure if we got episode 3 we could have also added Combine advisor grubs. Sadly we'll never truly know. \r\n\r\nThe new zombie types help make the Ravenholm chapter. If it was only the original zombie and head crab type I think it would not be as scary as it is. I love the zombie that has 4-5 black head crabs on his back that just tanks damage, and the ones with no skin that chase you like a dog chasing a car. They make that chapter a lot more intense.\r\n\r\nWithout the ant lions, 4 of the chapters of the first Half-life 2 would be a lot more empty and uneventful. The rhinos add for a good challenge and, while you may hate the normal ant lions at the start, as soon as you get bug bait they instantly become your brothers in combat. I think that's cool as shit :)\r\nThey're also a huge part in Episode 2 as you go through the caves for the larve and they get a couple new enemy types and a bit of lore. Like that they have ties with Vortigaunts because the Vortigaunts are known for ant lion husbandry. \r\n\r\nEvery single enemy helps form the identity of the chapters they are in. They all do those jobs incredibly well. Down to the choppers that always give you this anxiety of \"I gotta get the hell out of here\" while also giving you that thrill of being a badass who's jumping ramps while avoiding bullets, mines and rockets. Water hazard is underrated. \r\n\r\nI could ramble hours upon hours about this game. And, I kinda want to, I don't think I've met that many people who have delved into the world of Half-life and not been deeply interested in it. Its lore is so vast while keeping so many secrets. I still am blown away that this shares a world with portal. \r\n\r\nBut I shouldn't write for days on end and you shouldn't read a review for a game you already know is magnificent for days on end. Anyway, thanks for reading :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1733913854, "timestamp_updated": 1733913854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182485123", "author": {"steamid": "76561199584681944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1734521234}, "language": "english", "review": "It's me, Gordon!

The environmental storytelling, experimental approach to teaching you the game mechanics, clever puzzles and level design really showcase how far ahead of the curve the developers at Valve were at the time.

Very innovative.\n- Great, iconic level design.\n- Very good story.\n- Very immersive.\n- Great horror elements.\n- Good music/audio design.\n- Graphics and art design still holds up very well.\n- Solid enemy AI.\n- Many interactive objects and physics puzzles. The Ravenholm chapter demonstrates this well.\n- Still gets occasional updates and fixes.\n- The 20th anniversary update added Episode One and Episode Two into the base game for free.\n- Episode Two is great.\n- Steam Workshop mod support.\n\n[h3][Mixed][/h3]\n- Episode One is just okay.\n\n[h3][The Negatives][/h3]\n- Some sections don't hold up the best. The Water Hazard chapter is just okay.\n- The games leak before release led to a lot of content being scrapped or changed. This led to some awkward changes but it doesn't really impact the final product too much.\n- Contains one of the most notorious unresolved cliffhangers in gaming history.\n\n[h3][Conclusion][/h3]\nHalf-Life 2 is easily one of the greatest, most influential FPS games of all time.

It's a journey into a world where oppression reigns, and a lone scientist, Gordon Freeman, becomes the unlikely symbol of hope.

The oppressive Combine regime, with its towering structures and omnipresent surveillance, creates a sense of constant tension and unease.\r\n\r\nBut Half-Life 2 is more than just a dystopian setting. It's a story about resistance, about ordinary people finding extraordinary courage in the face of overwhelming odds. The characters, from the gruff but loyal Barney Calhoun to the enigmatic Alyx Vance, are unforgettable. Their struggles and triumphs resonate deeply, making you truly care about their fate.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is equally captivating. The game's innovative physics engine allows you to interact with the environment in ways never seen before. You can use gravity guns to manipulate objects, solve intricate puzzles, and even launch enemies into the air. The combat is thrilling, blending strategic thinking with adrenaline-pumping action.\r\n\r\nHalf-Life 2's world is a masterpiece of environmental storytelling. Each location, from the eerie canals of Ravenholm to the sprawling industrial complexes of Nova Prospekt, is meticulously designed to create a unique atmosphere.

Two new insights I gained on this playthrough (spoilers):\n\n- I always found the singing vortiguant listened to him sing, then carried on. I never knew he had so much incredible dialogue upon clicking. I spent 5 minutes just listening to him and the profound insights into what gordon freeman truly stands for. An incredible little moment among so many others.\n\n- Returning to city 17 after nova prospekt is terrifying. It genuinely feels like war. My heart was constantly racing as I had to overcome what felt like genuinely impossible odds. Back pressed against a pillar, licking my lips as I stared at a rocket supply box which in that moment felt like the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen. Though it was only a foot away, it might as well have been 100 with the giant strider lighting up the area in between. \n\nTurning in all directions as the combine destroy the ground beneath me in a parking deck, frantically diving for cover and killing as many as I can. \n\nSeeing the poor unfortunate rebels get eviscerated and watching their bodies smack down beside me like a wet towel. I felt the revolution in City 17 that day and I\u2019ll never forget it. \n\n- Touching on the first point, but I always wonder whats going through freemans mind. As he dangles helplessly in front of Dr. Breen who in turn dangles a horrifying proposition in front of him: Betray his comrades, and become the face of the combine. On the surface it seems obvious, of course he wouldn\u2019t. But then I remember the end of Half life 1, where he was given a similar ultimatum. A choice to live in servitude of the unknown, or die, free. He made his choice. I wonder\u2026 if Mossman hadnt acted as she did and gordon had time to think, would he still have that same resolve? Or maybe his development over the course of the game is gaining exactly that. Going from a scared civilian, to a hero who carries the world on his shoulders. And after carrying it for so long, now has the strength to choose death as a free man.

Instead, half life is innovation, every title that came out was a big step in videogames as a whole. Half Life 1 introduced the concept that FPS games can have a story and a lot more to them than just run and gun, Half Life 2 pushed hard on graphics, physics and everything basically, and Alyx is a testament to how much potential VR games have.\r\n\r\nSomething to note is, half life 2 is a bit odd. Feels like they pushed tech over gameplay. So while it's still good, it just falls a bit short from half life 1. Enemy variety is much smaller and while there aren't enemies that appear once and never again ( 3 ceiling turrets types in Half Life 1, and so many other enemies I remember) it can make the game feel a little more... stale, combine barely shows any new tricks. And any other enemies are basically just zombies, faster zombies, headcrabs, faster headcrabs, cool poison headcrabs with a clevel reverse poison mechanic that are an exception, but still not enough to give much variety. And antlions which have a way to avoid (a car, or platforming) and act more like a punishment for not playing the intended way. \r\n\r\nWhat HL2 does have is a much better handcrafted experience, while you do go on a car trip for 1.5 hours where barely anything happens, the game switches it's themes a lot and it managed to almost never get stale like a long fun carefully made experience. Half Life 1 can feel like a fever dream with the odd maybe believable but often random places you go, you get to the surface, back to the facility through a vent, into a reactor core, then a random tentacle boss, then a mine under it, then trainstation, then... it's hard to keep track of, but I do remember every chapter in HalfLife 2 because of the bigger emphasis on quality over quantity, while Surface Tension is loved by many in half life 1, and I liked the chapter too, but jeez it's so loooooong, it's a big reason why everyone dislikes the finale, because the game is just dragging out at this point. And while half life 2 (excluding episodes) does end a bit abruptly, it's a roller coaster of fun and well executed ideas in a (almost) perfect flow. \r\n\r\nAn amazing one time experience in every way, perhaps a little too small gun variety because it takes a backseat to using enviroment to kill enemies, you find the last gun before halfway through the game", "timestamp_created": 1741964452, "timestamp_updated": 1741964452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190171463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114521123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 212, "playtime_at_review": 3879, "last_played": 1741961158}, "language": "english", "review": "story, gameplay & immersion wise this game in 2025 beats 90% of the modern slop publishers call AAAA", "timestamp_created": 1741964044, "timestamp_updated": 1741964044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190170390", "author": {"steamid": "76561199046812430", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1241, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1742471919}, "language": "english", "review": "take down society\r\n\r\ni enjoyed", "timestamp_created": 1741963208, "timestamp_updated": 1741963208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "73993593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331189736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 176, "playtime_forever": 9253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9253, "last_played": 1733273681}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Sorry Dr. Breen, but I need my Half Life, too.\"\n\n*blows up all teh combines and epicaly saves the day*", "timestamp_created": 1596919606, "timestamp_updated": 1741961086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190153932", "author": {"steamid": "76561199508844297", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 301, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1742661183}, "language": "english", "review": "I barely have played and this is one of the best games ive ever touched", "timestamp_created": 1741947469, "timestamp_updated": 1741947469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190152235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198804195679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 294, "playtime_at_review": 1113, "last_played": 1741943594}, "language": "english", "review": "good\n", "timestamp_created": 1741945037, "timestamp_updated": 1741945037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190142326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117614118", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1117, "playtime_at_review": 1117, "last_played": 1741929330}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm annoyed it took me this long to play this.

"review": "[h1][b]Half-Life 2 \u2013 The Legendary Game That Almost Melts the Ice[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Game Title:[/b] Half-Life 2  \n[b]Developer/Publisher:[/b] Valve  \n[b]Release Date:[/b] November 16, 2004  \n[b]Platforms:[/b] PC, Xbox, Xbox 360, PS3, Steam Deck  \n[b]Genre:[/b] First-Person Shooter, Action, Sci-Fi  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]Introduction \u2013 Ice Meets Gravity Guns[/b][/h2]  \nHowls and frostbitten greetings, my packmates! I\u2019m [b]Kiba Snowpaw[/b], Alpha Ice Wolf from the frozen lands of [b]HowlStrom[/b], where the winter hits every hundred years and games are judged with steel claws and sharp fangs. With 38+ years of gaming and over 5,000 titles etched into my mind, I don\u2019t let nostalgia glaze my eyes with frost. Today, I\u2019m diving into the behemoth that is [b]Half-Life 2[/b], a game many call \"timeless.\" But is it really? I\u2019ve played both [b]Half-Life 1[/b] and its sequel, and despite its brilliance, HL2 walks a different path that leans a little too mainstream for my taste.  \n\nDoes that mean it\u2019s bad? No. [b]Half-Life 2[/b] still stands as a monumental achievement that revolutionized FPS games. But with years of hindsight and ten playthroughs behind me, there\u2019s a lot of ground to cover\u2014some warm, some frozen stiff. Let\u2019s unravel this classic with a blend of love, critique, and maybe some wolf-like snark.  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]Basic Plot Summary \u2013 Freeman, Crowbars, and Combines[/b][/h2]  \nYou wake up as Gordon Freeman, legendary silent protagonist, pulled from stasis by the enigmatic [b]G-Man[/b]. Earth has fallen under the iron fist of the [b]Combine[/b], an interdimensional alien force. The world is a shadow of its former self\u2014gritty, oppressed, and bleak. Humans live under totalitarian rule in a dystopian city called [b]City 17[/b], and the resistance is scattered and barely hanging on.  \n\nYour goal?  \n[list]  \n[*] Escape City 17.  \n[*] Rally the resistance.  \n[*] Fight your way through Combine forces and restore some semblance of hope.  \n[/list]  \n\nThe game keeps you moving across diverse locales: the urban sprawl of City 17, zombie-infested Ravenholm, desolate highways, and Combine fortresses. While [b]Half-Life 1[/b] was about escaping Black Mesa, HL2 broadens its world-building. That said, it trades the intimate horror and tight pacing of its predecessor for more epic, set-piece-driven storytelling.  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]Originality \u2013 The Birth of Modern FPS Design[/b][/h2]  \nLet\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due: Half-Life 2 redefined the FPS genre. The innovations at the time were mind-blowing, and many mechanics are still used in today\u2019s games.  \n\n[b]What Made HL2 Original:[/b]  \n[list]  \n[*] [b]The Gravity Gun:[/b] Physics-based combat and puzzles were revolutionary. Using saw blades and barrels as weapons felt fresh.  \n[*] [b]Seamless Storytelling:[/b] No cutscenes\u2014everything happened in-engine and in real time.  \n[*] [b]Immersive World-Building:[/b] City 17 felt alive, oppressive, and believable. Environmental storytelling was king.  \n[*] [b]AI and Enemy Design:[/b] Combine Soldiers used flanking tactics, and enemies like headcrabs and Striders felt unique and challenging.  \n[/list]  \n\nHowever, this innovation came with compromise. By going mainstream, HL2 lost some of the hardcore charm of HL1. Puzzles became more physics-driven and less brain-teasing, and combat was polished but safer.  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]The Studio \u2013 Valve and the Birth of Steam\u2019s Empire[/b][/h2]  \nValve was at the peak of its powers in 2004. Coming off the success of [b]Half-Life 1[/b], they gambled big on two things:  \n[list]  \n[*] The groundbreaking [b]Source Engine[/b], which powered HL2\u2019s physics and visuals.  \n[*] The launch of [b]Steam[/b], their digital distribution platform.  \n[/list]  \n\nIn a way, Half-Life 2 wasn\u2019t just a game; it was Valve\u2019s declaration of dominance in both development and distribution. The game was polished to near perfection, a feat few studios could achieve then or now.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: Valve\u2019s meticulous focus on mainstream appeal meant HL2 felt a little less risky compared to its predecessor. It\u2019s a beautiful, slick machine, but one that feels a bit\u2026 \u201csafe.\u201d  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]Gameplay Mechanics \u2013 Physics, Puzzles, and Pulse Rifles[/b][/h2]  \nLet\u2019s break this down into chunks, because HL2\u2019s gameplay is its heart:  \n\n[b]1. Combat:[/b]  \nHL2\u2019s shooting mechanics are rock solid, but weapons feel hit-or-miss.  \n[list]  \n[*] The [b]Crowbar[/b] and [b]Gravity Gun[/b] are iconic and fun to use.  \n[*] Standard guns like the SMG and AR2 feel underwhelming.  \n[*] Enemies are well-designed, but battles often lean on AI swarms rather than strategy.  \n[/list]  \n\n[b]2. Puzzles and Physics:[/b]  \nValve made physics part of the gameplay loop. Puzzles often involve using the Gravity Gun to manipulate objects\u2014fun at first but repetitive by the tenth playthrough.  \n\n[b]3. Vehicle Segments:[/b]  \nHL2 introduces long vehicle sections (Highway 17 and the airboat), which are divisive. They\u2019re visually impressive but can feel like filler.  \n\n[b]4. Pacing and Exploration:[/b]  \nHL2 keeps you moving but offers little replay value. Areas like Ravenholm shine with horror vibes, while others feel empty after multiple playthroughs.  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]Character Development \u2013 Alyx Vance and Friends[/b][/h2]  \nCharacters are HL2\u2019s emotional anchor.  \n[list]  \n[*] [b]Alyx Vance:[/b] A relatable, well-written companion. Her presence lightens the game\u2019s darker tones. (And yes, I modded her outfits. Don\u2019t judge; I\u2019m a wolf with eyes for beauty!)  \n[*] [b]Dr. Kleiner and Barney:[/b] Quirky and memorable, adding levity to the grim setting.  \n[*] [b]G-Man:[/b] Mysterious and unnerving as always.  \n[/list]  \n\nHowever, Gordon Freeman remains silent, which can feel awkward in emotional scenes.  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]Impact and Legacy \u2013 A Cultural Phenomenon[/b][/h2]  \nHalf-Life 2 defined a generation. It set the standard for FPS storytelling, physics, and immersion. It inspired games like [b]Bioshock[/b], [b]Portal[/b], and [b]Modern Warfare[/b]. Valve\u2019s Source Engine also became a powerhouse for mods, birthing classics like [b]Garry\u2019s Mod[/b].  \n\nYet, here\u2019s my howl: HL2\u2019s influence has overshadowed its flaws. Its pacing drags in parts, its guns lack impact, and its puzzles feel repetitive.  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]Praise and Critique \u2013 My Balanced Howl[/b][/h2]  \n[b]What I Loved:[/b]  \n[list]  \n[*] Incredible atmosphere and world-building.  \n[*] The Gravity Gun\u2014still unmatched in its creativity.  \n[*] Alyx Vance and NPC interactions.  \n[*] Source Engine physics and visuals.  \n[/list]  \n\n[b]What I Didn\u2019t Love:[/b]  \n[list]  \n[*] Some guns lack punch (looking at you, SMG).  \n[*] Repetitive puzzles after multiple playthroughs.  \n[*] Vehicle segments overstayed their welcome.  \n[*] Gordon Freeman\u2019s silence feels outdated.  \n[/list]  \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]Conclusion \u2013 A Masterpiece, But Not My Favorite[/b][/h2]  \n[b]Half-Life 2[/b] is undeniably brilliant. It revolutionized FPS games and remains iconic to this day. But as an Ice Wolf who cherishes the gritty challenge of [b]Half-Life 1[/b], HL2 feels more polished but less daring. It catered to a wider audience, sacrificing some of its predecessor\u2019s hardcore edge.  \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad\u2014far from it! HL2 is a must-play experience that still holds up. Just don\u2019t be surprised if you find it less magical on your tenth playthrough, like I did.  \n\n[b]Verdict:[/b] [i]9/10 \u2013 An icy classic that still roars, but not without a few frost cracks.[/i] \ud83d\udc3a  \n", "timestamp_created": 1734486284, "timestamp_updated": 1734486284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0,

The game was truly ahead of its time, especially when you realize it came out in 2004,it's unbelievable. The graphics were impressive, and the Eastern European look in the post-apocalyptic world was stunning. The soldiers, the gravity gun it was all awesome, not to mention the fantastic sound design. The special vehicle missions were a great touch, and the characters were well done. One of the best things HL2 excels at is its companion AI\u2014it was genuinely smart. The facial expressions and dialogues were spot-on, making the characters feel so real, especially Alyx. The non-cutscene gameplay added to the immersion. However, the combat was just okay and somewhat mediocre, with no special standout moments. I also dislike that you can't aim down sights (ADS). Another downside is the antagonist, who wasn\u2019t particularly intimidating\u2014just plain annoying. The story was decent, but the main reason I play HL2 is because of the world-building and immersion. Special mention to one of the best villains in gaming history, the G-Man.

Okay, let's go:\n\nHalf-Life 2: A better game than HL1 in many reguards. However, whoever decided that putting sprint, flashlight and underwater oxygen on the same meter was a good idea; you deserve to be fired and your mom's a hoe. secondly, whoever made the sneaky poison headcrabs and their zombies, your mom is also a hoe. and thirdly, the buggy vehicle section is better than the airboat, fight me. Other than those grievances, it's a good experience. Revenholm is a ball-buster and Nova Prospekt is easily the best level in the entire base game. Good on it's own at any price.\n\nHL2: E1: The weakest of the two episodes, in my opinion. could easily have been combined with HL2: E2 and literally nothing would have changed. you stop the citadel from exploding, travel around with Alyx for awhile (who is a rock solid companion, by the way, no complaints about her pulling her own weight and being a legit help.) save some civvies, and board a train. That's it. Also, too many d*mn striders, they can f*ck off. Overcharged Grav Gun is a blast though.\n\nHL2: E2: the best of the bunch, and almost better than the base game for all that you're doing in it in a short time.  Different environments, a better vehicle section than both of HL2's, a new and decently dangerous foe in the hunters and acid ant-lions, which are a nuisance best dealt with via shotgun. Again, too many striders, but this time escorted by hunters. The end fight with striders is an text of anxiety that ends in a cliffhanger that may never be resolved.\n\nOverall: 8/10. I just wish after 20 years there was continuation of the series that didn't need a 400 dollar piece of kit to play a 60 dollar game. Also wait until Valve's backlog of games goes on sale so you can get the bundle, and all of valves games besides Alyx for dirt cheap.", "timestamp_created": 1734334126, "timestamp_updated": 1734590767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "183093144", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026442858", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1486, "last_played": 1733890689}, "language": "english", "review": "gordon freeman\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1734588280, "timestamp_updated": 1734588280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "183092515", "author": {"steamid": "76561199360950932", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1734880572}, "language": "english", "review": "yes.", "timestamp_created": 1734587308, "timestamp_updated": 1734587308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "183092135", "author": {"steamid": "76561199349602413", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 806, "last_played": 1683778539}, "language": "english", "review": "Half Life 2.

And its about 20 hours\n\nHalf-Life 2 Episode 1:\nA pretty good first episode but there are no new weapons (and i don't think any new enemies ether) that's its only like 4-5 hours.\n\nHalf-Life 2 Episode 2: \nA really good second episode that adds four new enemies (no new weapons unless you count the bomb things at the end)\nThat is about 6\u00bd hours. But the car part if you are trying to get the Little Rocket Man achievement is super infuriating so be warned.\n\nHalf-Life 2 Lost Coast:\nIt is basically just a 20 minute level with (to my knowledge) almost no story& no achievements. its good but its over before you know it.", "timestamp_created": 1734586288, "timestamp_updated": 1734586288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "183090440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201263177", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 987, "last_played": 1736553350}, "language": "english", "review": "gorrrrrrdonnnnnnnn freeeeeeemannnnnnnnnnnnnnn\r\n\r\n\r\ndefining early 2000s adventure shooters. cool story + dystopia + headcrabs :3", "timestamp_created": 1734584324, "timestamp_updated": 1734584324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "183090245", "author": {"steamid": "76561199624933478", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 148, "playtime_at_review": 3238, "last_played": 1742433887}, "language": "english", "review": "just got all 69 achievements as a first time player! absolutely legendary!", "timestamp_created": 1734584051, "timestamp_updated": 1734584051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "183086763", "author": {"steamid": "76561199477402682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1031, "deck_playtime_at_review": 1002, "last_played": 1734980606}, "language": "english", "review": "SPACE SPACE SPACE SPACE SPAC- IS THAT A HEADCRAB ON A ROCKET!?", "timestamp_created": 1734579404, "timestamp_updated": 1734579404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, {"recommendationid": "183086503", "author": {"steamid": "76561199726529419", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1736901524}, "language": "english", "review": "I get the Hype.

The game-play and story-line still hold up 20 years after it's release. Overall, I'm very happy with my time spent playing Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Episode 1 and 2. \r\n\r\nMy main gripe with HL2 is the level design. I [b] very [/b] frequently found myself lost, confused, and looking for the way forward. You could say its a skill issue, sure, and I never claimed to be an elite, skilled player. But judging by the number of walkthrough views, articles, posts, and more, I'm not the only person that struggled. And it wasn't the puzzles, either - those were fine. But there were numerous instances where I'd find myself looking for a door that wasn't there, or a box to jump over a fence all to find out that there was a secret vent hidden really well or a doorway that was so out of the way it couldn't possibly seem like the way forward. Overall, the level design in this game is really un-avoidably non-linear, and this is suprising given how story-driven and not-open-world HL2 is. \r\n\r\nStill, I pushed through, and I'm glad I did, because it made it the stellar moments of the game much more special. One of my personal favorite moments is [spoiler] near the end of Episode 2 where Gordon is tasked with destroying the Striders with the Magnusson device. [/spoiler] That moment in particular feels really well polished, and I'm glad I stuck it out through the main game's confusing level design and somewhat janky movement mechanics. Which brings me to my next point.\r\n\r\nThe movement in this game is weird. It's never entirely clear where you can and can't go, what is too high, where you can crouch and crawl under, how far you should run before you try to cross a gap, how far you slide after you land, etc. That last point was especially frustrating. [spoiler] There are several longer platforming sections through the three installments of HL2, some of which it is possible to fall all the way back to where you started. [/spoiler] This isn't the end of the world, and is more of an annoyance, but it does make for some incredibly frustrating moments where you're close to being able to either move on to a next checkpoint or complete a more difficult survival section, all to be stunted because Gordon decided to slide a little too far after he jumped. Weird, but not unmanageable.\r\n\r\nThose two gripes are [u] literally the only complaints I have about Half-Life 2. [/u] And it makes sense that those two would stick out IMO, because it was released in 2004. For a game released that long ago, it is damn near close to perfect. Just a few little, tiny, minor flaws. I'm not the first person to say this, and I won't be the last, but Valve is brain-dead if they don't release a third installment to the Half-Life franchise. Especially considering the success and hype surrounding Half-Life: Alyx, it almost makes no sense at all to just completely abandon this franchise, it being one of the most beloved and cherished pieces of video game history ever made.\r\n\r\nThank you Valve. Half-Life 2 and the episodes that followed were awesome. Now please, make a third installment. We all want it. Just do it.

There is a sense of atmosphere, dystopia, nostalgia, intrigue, and bits of humor to this game I just love, but also find myself getting chills as its themes still feel so relevant twenty years later. This game was only 99 cents when I bought it and there is hardly anything I can think of that offers a better quality-to-price ratio today. The addition of refreshed graphics and the synthesis of episodes one and two into the game makes this game an indispensable part of any gaming collection.\n\nGordon Freeman may be a silent protagonist, but the cast around him is anything but. Alyx brings heart to the story while characters like Dr. Kleiner and Barney bring warmth and humor. The levels and transitions between them are so engaging that I often found myself forgetting that this game is a linear story, aided by the pulsing electronica of its iconic soundtrack. Every combat encounter feels visceral and demands dynamic creativity.

From its immersive storytelling to its revolutionary physics engine, it set new standards for game design.

The AI is intelligent, making every encounter feel fresh and challenging, and the world-building is unmatched, with every location feeling alive and rich in detail.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is still one of the best shooters ever made, and its impact on gaming can still be felt today.

Didn't like how the movement system felt accelerating and decelerating like that. Source movement always bothered me it's always something I have in mind when playing any valve title even the gldsrc ones. Makes precise jumps and stuff just funky. People literally have to study the movement system to get better at it, and you definitely can get better at it it's just that I don't care too much for. The physics are cool especially knowing it's like 20yrs old now, the effects and how it's implemented are neat but don't expect for any bugs or the nature of it not to fuck you over especially in parts where you have to balance on floating props. The level design's dated and kind of confusing. It's linear but has a lot of corners that you'd think leads to somewhere else. And sometimes to advance forwards you'd have to do something you didn't think was possible in the game (I guess this can be taken in a good way), coupled with how the levels are designed it makes for a confusing and choppy first playthrough with a lot of stops on youtube for a walkthrough. Definitely better than it was in hl1 though. I really hate the level designs and it only starts getting better in episode 2, I pretty much went through that like a nice cool breeze relatively speaking.\r\n\r\nPlaying through the story even though I already knew how it went via youtube and the fact it's 20yrs old, it was still a pretty cool experience. Nowadays gman's seen as either an sfm prop or a 1hr video essay. You definitely can sense he is a serious character but you never really felt his ominous aura through skibidi toilet or just youtube in general. Playing through the games and seeing how he acted especially in that part in episode 2, it was so cooool. Rly loved that \"prepare for unforseen consequences\" literally sent a shiver down my spine. The story otherwise was kinda basic (?) to me it felt more like a way to establish the world and atmosphere for the experience specifically not for telling some Oscar level writing. But you'll still love the characters and that whole world building thing really pays off in some sequences. Alyx is weirdly clingy tho I hate that. You shouldn't really come for the story specifically, just for the game and the experience itself. \r\n\r\nNot much else to say about this game. You can get used to how finicky it is like how the people did then. I'm probs gon replay the entire series with knowledge of how the levels flow and maybe modded to make it more modern (recommend mmod).", "timestamp_created": 1733815025, "timestamp_updated": 1733815025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "86950392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161101229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 855, "last_played": 1733828372}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright..

"[quote=Terry Davis, probably]Alyx Vance gave me yellow fever but I was cured by God and now prefer anime girls.[/quote]\n\nOkay, it would be a joke to write a serious review for this game and there are enough purposefully funny ones already, so I'll just share a personal anecdote here, given how we've just had our twenty-year anniversary.\n\nI remember that I had this game installed on my first computer. The icon was neatly put on the desktop above the green hills of the beloved XP but I could never get it to run: it gave some serious error message that I could not read. I was bothered, but didn't mind that much, as I had Far Cry and Doom 3 to finish, released around the same time, tightly fitting onto my hard disk measuring only maybe a hundred of gigabytes. I felt at ease knowing that my games only take around two to six each, giving me ample opportunity to never get bored for years to come, even on my old beige setup.\n\nEventually I found the folder this game was installed to. There was an ominous '[i][u]hl2.exe[/u][/i]' we all fear and love, a folder called '[i]root[/i]' and another one by the name of '[i]Half Life 2 Episode One[/i]'. I explored them and found strange screenshots of 3D models with sky blue background looking at me. Soldiers, vehicles, a women in white sweater, weird contraptions with dark blue metal construction, all standing still. I listened to the sounds, the music, trying to guess the story-line from the cryptic map names, such as '[i]d1_trainstation_01[/i]' or '[i]d2_prison_08[/i]'. I figured we would arrive at a train station, but I could not imagine how would we end up at a canal, then a prison even. I thought that canals had only existed in Venice, so I figured the game must take place in Italy... but what's it with all the futuristic looking gadgets then? I did not manage to put the whole picture together.\n\nAt school, I started to ask around and gather some gossips, but nobody has ever heard of this '[i]Half Life 2[/i]', much less played any of it. I was about to lose interest when I stumbled upon an executable file in Episode One's folder. Or perhaps it was a shortcut to some executable file that allowed it to use the '[i]episodic[/i]' folder. Either way, some time later, I was looking at the red sky with a huge building towering over me. I did not get anything happening around me, but I did not have to.\n\nNot knowing what this robot digging me out is, who this lady hugging me is, who those people speaking on a monitor are, what this huge building is or where we even are, I fell in love and patiently played on, the best that I could. I remember being stuck for a few days, weeks even at the energy ball socket puzzles. I stopped playing, messed around in Far Cry on the first level exclusively, then came back later with a fresh mind to this puzzle. I also had problems with the second chapter, not realizing that you had to climb onto the spinning thing and get off when it rotates you around next to the opposite ledge. That one challenge took me a few more weeks as well. I never really was a quick learner.\n\nAt around the dark chapter, I got scared a little bit and I had to stop, but I was curious about what could be happening next. I told my friends about this new game and we role-played whatever we thought '[i]Urban Flight[/i]' or '[i]Exit 17[/i]' could mean. They had no idea what was I talking about, but they did not mind either. Eventually I managed to get through Episode One and I was wondering if there's more. I tried to figure what was the issue with the shortcut on the desktop and it suddenly [i]clicked[/i] to me. It seems that the executable itself was sloppily copied out there and executing it gave errors naturally, as it could not find the game folder it belongs to. I copied the '[i]hl2.exe[/i]' back to its proper place and the suddenly spinning fans of my computer signified my resounding success.\n\nPlaying through the actual Half Life 2, not its first Episode, was a long haul back then, feeling like it took years out of my life. I still did not understand anything, not even little a bit, but I cared not, as it was nice to see some familiar faces appearing again. I met the armored man from '[i]Exit 17[/i]', seeming ever so relaxed. I saw the white-haired bearded man speaking in some monitors. I was wondering if he had legs, but after discovering cheats, it turns out he actually did not have any. I've seen this cheerful lady once again who escorted me through my previous adventure. He already seemed to know me well already. I could meet the man in glasses in person. I was also amazed by his [i]seismometer[/i], although I did not call that machine exactly like that back then, it was \"[i]a scratchy thing[/i]\" and just that. I also wore glasses like him and I was hoping I would grow up to be as smart as this old man is, with my own laboratory hidden well away from prying eyes. I'd do nothing but mix together fluids and note down whatever happens. Maybe someone will care about the results. Meanwhile, I was also wondering, why no one else wore eyeglasses in this game when it is so common in real life.\n\nEventually I got stuck at the infamous blue barrel section and I never really figured out what to do. I was bored, kept clicking the friends button that did nothing, but eerily mentioning a certain Steam network that could not be reached. I replayed the game, thinking I must have missed something along the way. After a while, I decided that this cannot go on any longer. I shyly searched on the internet, not wanting to be seen by my parents failing at a game, and found something of this manner: '[i]half life 2 cheats[/i]', at a website dedicated for this sort of criminality. After a struggle with getting the developer console to work, given how I had to create a shortcut with the correct working directory and command line arguments, I managed to get a gray window open up and the world was my oyster. Soon after, I finished the game one hundred percent clean and wondered what will happen next, whether there would be a sequel, only to find out years later that it was this Episode One I've already known so well...\n\nAll my friends back then had already forgotten about this certain game '[i]Half Life 2[/i]' and did not share my joy of finishing it, but I still did remember every moment fondly. Eventually, we had to format the computer for the new Windows 7 coming out and I wondered if I would ever see this game again. I even started to forget its name and life just got too quick to have time pondering about old toys along the way.\n\nYears later, while searching mods for San Andreas, I heard about this '[i]gee-mod[/i]' that had some relation to San Andreas in the form of '[i]ragdolls[/i]' and it sure did sound interesting. I installed it, loaded up a map and while looking at the blue cannon in my hands, every piece soon came together...\n\nI started making lame videos in GMod, then among the mount options I've seen this curious '[i]Team Fortress 2[/i]' with funny-looking rubber men in it. I soon learned all the videos made for it by heart. To my fortune, the Meet the Medic update was about to come along. I heard that they made that game absolutely free! I just knew that I had to try it. I climbed onto this certain Steam platform that I had already forgotten about and soon it had become clear: Valve has patiently had been building me a home all along.\n\nLooking back, I wonder if my life would be any different, had I not tried Half Life 2. I wonder if I would've filled the space with something else, or if I was bound to stumble upon it anyways and fall in love the same way as I did actually. Call of Duty was all the rage back then, even I liked the second one's single player on Recruit difficulty only, but we were too poor to own consoles, much less to subscribe to an online service for multiplayer, so I was left out of all the fun. Whatever I could get working on my old beige computer was what I had to be content with.\n\nAnd content I was.", "timestamp_created": 1733785505, "timestamp_updated": 1733789006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182377086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275643584", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 773, "last_played": 1735048456}, "language": "english", "review": "Phenomenal game.

After the update that put base game with all expansions together besides deathmatch (great thing for me specifically, because now I don't have five identical icons for hl2, hl2 ep1, hl2 ep2, lost coast and deatmatch but just two). BUT one thing that really bothered me in base hl2 were holes in map geometry and intentionally missing textures where the devs thought player couldn't see (f.e.: behind collapsed bridges and barricades in canals, side of the yellow building with combine barricade in anticitizen one, overwatch station's copule etc.). Now they're ALL fixed (at least the circa 25 cases I knew of) which makes me really happy as it was basically my only issue with hl2. The new shadows and specular lighting and light casting looks cool too because now hl2 is visually consistent with the episodes.\nAnd the best thing for gooners everywhere is the addition of workshop support!\nps: they also changed the text font in game which is a welcome addition as well as the previous font used look too much like a system font you would only use in a debugger or something, it just didn't look good.\n[h3]comprehensive list of all fixed bugs/glitches/graphical enhancements that were easily noticable in the past that weren't specifically mentioned in the patchnotes[/h3]\n\nTITLE SCREEN\n- previously if you clicked on the dash in the hl2 logo the whole text would dissapear for however long you were holding down the m1 button, with the new font nothing like that happens (you can still trigger it in portal because it uses the old font, just click somewhere in the middle of the portal logo/title)\n\nPOINT INSERTION\n- gutters now have inside texture so they look like actual tubes from all sides, this is the case in all following maps that have gutters\n\nA RED LETTER DAY\n- d1_trainstation_05 - lamarr doesn't dissappear the moment she climbs in the vent but when she is well out of view (i think they might have just darkened the inside of the vent but the effect is still the same\n\nROUTE CANAL\n- the big wooden panels laying everywhere in this chapter are now breakable\n- d1_canals_01 - the train doesn't launch you into the stratosphere when you jump on it when it's moving for a second time\n- d1_canals_02 - in the see-saw puzzle they added a submerged pipe at side where you lay the cinderlocks, I think it helps with the gravity when you jump over the ledge after you solve the puzzle, before there was a large chance that your jump would tip the see-saw over and you couldn't make the jump\n- d1_canals_03 - the door in the manhack mack's den is no longer breakable using the crowbar\n\nWATER HAZARD\n- d1_canals_06 - after the ramp jump if you continued on foot you would be able to see a completely still dropship (no animations, like a statue), now it always moves properly\n- blocked of paths (either by collapsed bridges or drainage grates) have fully finished geometry (before the water ended too soon and you could kinda see the edge of the skybox and other weird stuff), the most drastic change is noticable at the very end of d1_canals_10 behind the collapsed bridge left of the tunnel\n\nBLACK MESA EAST\n- d1_eli_01 - before you enter you can swim forward to the grates, before you could see unfinished mapping through the grates just as in water hazard, check for yourself between versions\n\nWE DON'T GO TO RAVENHOLM\n - specular fog helps hide edges of the maps you could easily see from rooftops\n\nHIGHWAY 17 + SANDTRAPS\n- there are traffic signs all around the coast, previously you could rip them out of the ground (metal pole and all) with the gravity gun, moving it around caused all sorts of weird physics to happen, now you can just take of the sign itself without the post\n- d2_coast_01 - don't know if this was specifically fixed in the 20th anniversary update but there used to be an issue where if you flipped the buggy over using anything but the gravity gun the game would think it's still upside down and would require you to punt the buggy with the gravity gun before proceeding\n- d2_coast_05 - in the main gas station building there used to be a cube/box with dev textures (must have been a remnant of the beta build of this map), now it's completely removed\n- specular fog helps hide edges of the sea you could see before out of the edge of your screen (previously mainly visible in d2_coast_08, you could see how the sea was made of big squares and you could see where they ended, now it's absolutely impossible to see)\n- d2_coast_09 - in the big house where rollermines drop from the roof, they fixed the roof from the outside hiding the prefab hole models, in the same house on the second floor it seemed like the floor was sticky (physics object acted all weird, rollermines stopped in place then suddenly jolted up again) now there are no more problems\n\nNOVA PROSPEKT - nothing really of note\n\nENTANGELMENT\n- d2_prison_07 - there was one minor case of z-fighting on the metal framing in the second turret defense room\n\nANTICITIZEN ONE\n- d3_c17_05 - the yellow house with the combine barricade didn't have a wall on the right side (previously you could see it if you went on the walkway and squeezed to the right\n- d3_c17_08 - the first window that manhacks burst through now has a texture of a broken window afterwards, before the update when the window broke there was just a clear hole afterward\n- the metal door with a bar holding it closed has to be opened using gravity gun through a grated window, previously there was an issue where you could throw explosives through (which didn't really make sense)\n\nFOLLOW FREEMAN\n- d3_c17_09 - on the upper-most floor (where Barney is hiding) a crow used to get stuck in the geometry when trying to fly away, this no longer happens (I can't tell if they deleted the crow or fixed the issue but it doesn't really matter)\n- d3_c17_10b - in the overwatch hq you could see the copule was missing some polygons (again, devs thought you couldn't see them), a lot of the windows indented in the walls were missing the textures around the frames\n\nOUR BENEFACTORS\n- d3_citadel_04 - before you ride the elevator the railing around the hole where it later arrives is up, you could jump on it and press e and you would activate the hl1 railcart driving controls along with the ui, you can still do it now but the ui doesn't appear\n\nDARK ENERGY\n- at the very end after you kill breen and get frozen in place after the skybox seemingly switched to another one, this still happens but isn't nearly as noticable, also when gman appears and you move your head he kind of jittered in place, this also still happens but is almost unnoticable\n\nSOME REALLY OBSCURE STUFF\n- in d1_canals_01 in the house with the collapsed roof you could shoot the scanner down when it was high above the house and the battery it dropped would get stuck on an invisible barrier in the air, this no longer happens (or at least I'm unable to replicate it)\n- in d3_c17_06b you could do all sorts of weird stuff with the liftable bridge (plant hoppermines on the bridge, then lift it and the mine wouldn't move with the bridge, same with fe.: a health pack etc., everything seems to work now without problems)\n\nTHINGS I WOULD STILL LIKE TO SEE FIXED/ADDED\n- base Half-Life 2 now has lighting and fog effects on par with the episodes, the only thing that's missing is full HDR on all surfaces, I don't think it should be that difficult to add it but you would most likely have to go through all the maps one by one\n- the orange desk lamp (first seen in Barney's office in d1_trainstation_01) CAN NEVER STAND UPRIGHT, IT ALWAYS TOPPLES OVER\n- in d2_coast_05 - there is a truck blocking the way, you have to shoot a barrel to make it fall down to the sea, when it catches fire it still uses the old fire particles, pretty easy fix, just change emitter particles in hammer\n", "timestamp_created": 1711550653, "timestamp_updated": 1733788519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182376711", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076590406", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1733790464}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1733788224, "timestamp_updated": 1733788224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "180915371", "author": {"steamid": "76561199484827230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1019, "last_played": 1735516130}, "language": "english", "review": "i hope all the npc squad members become stalkers b/c they are all useless except themedic and they block my movement", "timestamp_created": 1732925834, "timestamp_updated": 1733787786, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463701218366622925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182376260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374722044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 7864, "last_played": 1742525569}, "language": "english", "review": "classic game i love it = )", "timestamp_created": 1733787735, "timestamp_updated": 1733787735, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489510476589202881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182376197", "author": {"steamid": "76561199185026312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4452, "last_played": 1733969650}, "language": "english", "review": "you haven't played peak FPS till you've played this game", "timestamp_created": 1733787658, "timestamp_updated": 1733787658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "176080231", "author": {"steamid": "76561199219317801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4198, "last_played": 1739141883}, "language": "english", "review": "While I do prefer the first half life for its immediate replay value, half life 2 is a fantastic sequel that brings the franchise into epic proportions and is sill fun to play after 20 years. 8/10. \nHL2E1 -

many hours I've actually played this game it'd near 500 at least, always a blast to come back to every so often (once a year or so)\n\nThe 20th Anniversary combining all the episodes into one, as well as adding the workshop has made this game that much more replayable too, no more having to scrounge around ModDB and GameBanana for mods and campaigns, all of it can be found and accessed much much easier now.\n\nFor a game that came out 20+ years ago, it's still a visual marvel and a testament that consistent and intentional art direction for a game can do wonders for helping it look stunning, even now so many years later with so many advancements in technology. I can only imagine actually playing these titles back when they launched and being blown away by just how good these games look, even with some of HL2 having unfinished art in the later chapters, it never misses the mark in immersing you into this rich dystopian world.\n\nMy only gripe with the game in it's base form is that the gun sounds are very outdated and weak. I get this game came out in 2004 so I'm not expecting stellar weapon SFX, but every gun sounds rather puny (which to be fair was a pretty common issue with early 2000s shooters) which is why I'll now be playing with some SFX overhaul mods from the workshop as standard (I played MMoD for a good couple of hours over the base game just for this reason). Thats not to say the rest of the sound design in this game is bad, in fact it's consistently good across the board, they just dropped the ball a bit with the guns...\n\nVoice acting in this game is industry best, and I'm sure top of the line for 2004 with very memorable performances throughout. It is a bit jarring having literally every civilian have the same voice (male and female) but given their 1 year redevelopment of the entire game after the 2003 leak, and I imagine strained budget considering this, they don't sound bad at all and have so much style and flair. Michael Shapiro as GMan, especially in Ep2 knocks it out of the park having the most memorable speeches in any video game (imo).\n\nI hope to see this game get a remaster in Source2 one day given how actually gorgeous HL:A looked, but the RTX project looks like a very promising project, and I'm sure will give us a taste of what HL2 would look like given today's graphics technologies.\n\n10/10, a must have for anyone with \u00a38.50 to spare (and even cheaper on the many sales it goes on throughout the year).

of the hype from when it was released. Based on the raving reviews, I really expected something more than a mediocre horror railroading platformer, but that's what this game is.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective (playing on Windows), the game runs well and aged very well. The visuals are (technically) good, the voice acting is decent and the game is stable.\r\n\r\nAs for gameplay, it'd be hard for me to hate this more. I hate the stupid level designs that are intentionally frustrating, the endless spawning enemies, the inability to \"be careful\" in the game because enemies spawn no matter what, and spawn in scripted locations, no matter what. The levels are long, boring and poorly designed. The surprise attacks aren't fun because you know that once a level loads, there will be a story segment and something goes wrong and enemies will swarm. I just stopped playing out of a combination of frustration and intense boredom.\r\n\r\nIf \"mindless horror platformer\" is your cup of tea, this game might work for you. I don't think it lives up to its hype (not even close) - it was a technical achievement back in 2004 or so, but I cannot recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1734027945, "timestamp_updated": 1734027945, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458598732948303223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182585731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138318643", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 14889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4058, "last_played": 1736913064}, "language": "english", "review": "Bro it's literally half-life", "timestamp_created": 1734026661, "timestamp_updated": 1734026661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "139934426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150253413", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 6032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5479, "last_played": 1741251643}, "language": "english", "review": "surely theres a followup to this game right?", "timestamp_created": 1686562707, "timestamp_updated": 1734026037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182584661", "author": {"steamid": "76561199403235737", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1106, "last_played": 1734635536}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-life 2 is Half-life 1 on stero\u00efds...\r\nIncredibeule.", "timestamp_created": 1734025679, "timestamp_updated": 1734025679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182576361", "author": {"steamid": "76561199260373665", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1735151512}, "language": "english", "review": "Do i need to explain?\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1734017929, "timestamp_updated": 1734017929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "182575041", "author": {"steamid": "76561199168208558", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "playtime_at_review": 2196, "last_played": 1742570300}, "language": "english", "review": "20 years of half life 2...\r\n20 years, thats crazy!\r\nThey Added Workshop Support, Merged All The Games Into 1, Improved Graphical Fidelity, And a LOT more I cant fit into this review here.

Half-Life 1 was much better for its time. The expansions heavily involving Alyx are particularly grotesque.\n\nHalf-Life 2 and its subsequent universe would only be tolerable if it was coop or something.\n\nHere are some reasons why Half-Life 2 is garbage, and why I don't care if they ever release 3 because you know they're going to continue it in the same horrible vein:\n\nHalf-Life 2 was pretty much a glorified, hyped up tech demo.\n\nThe plot, the writing, etc. Seems like it took a huge turn away from what made the original great. It went from the first several seasons of the Simpsons to Bob's Burgers pretty much, from the original to this. No thanks. It never had the cojones the original had.\n\nAlyx. Barney, the others. Every single character... I hate all of their faces. Regrettably to say, that now includes Gordon Freeman.\n\nIf Gordon Freeman is the official Champion of Humanity, then he's the official champion of utter shit it seems. I'm beginning to hate the Gordon Freeman character just because of what this character \"represents\". Humanity actually really stinks like Half-Life 2 stinks to high hell.\n\nThis game is one giant shiny money making millennial turd \"designed for the 2000s\". BS. You lost the touch!\n\nThis game has no soul like Half-life 1 had. Another legitimate reason to hate this damn game...\n\nThe same type and amount of \"immersion\" and \"intensity\" of the first in the series is not really present. Everything feels weaker, everything seems as if it's out to hold Gordon's hand more.\n\nThe Half-Life saga was ruined and Half-Life 3 will really suck ass, no doubt about it. The hype will be extremely funny to check out however. I will laugh my ass off at it and all of you later for it, but maybe I'll be dead before it ever comes out. That'd be a relief.\n\nYou might as well play \"Hunt Down The Freeman\" which has very low average reviews but which is possibly a better experience than this cliched millennial garbage, even if the plot makes no sense and it's a horrible game. Crazily enough, it's not much worse than this, the overrated community elitist piece of shit that it's a spin-off of.\n\nI'm sure everyone will ooh and aah at Half-Life 3 when it comes out also, if it ever does. But the substance most likely won't be there and it'll be superseded by whatever else shortly after, but the oohs and aahs will at least last until then to make the developers think they are gods or whatever.

gaming. I prefer Half life 1 and its expansions to Half Life 2. The gameplay is slower than HL1 and the story is.. fine. Its passable but it does not make much sense when you consider what Black Mesa did. What Freeman did as well as others. Why is Freeman held up as a hero when as far as anyone knows, EVERYONE in Black Mesa are why the combine took over? The HEAD of Black Mesa is the one who surrendered to them and is now the one oppressing all of humanity.

vague as it may be, and left us asking more questions than it answered. 6 years after, Valve some how upped the ante again with this sequel. With a game engine more advanced than those that came before, a more open world you're exploring, a startling fascist rule by a ruthless force called \"the Combine\" and once again, more questions than answers. But it would be deeply unserious of me to not mention the 1 thing everyone would agree puts Half-Life 2 above the original, or at least sets it apart as an amazing title in it's own right: the Gravity-Gun. picking up objects and hurling them at enemies is a selling-point that should be good enough for most. It makes combat as open-ended and hilarious as you want to make it. But this isn't at all the only thing Half-Life 2 has going for it, every chapter has its own thing, it's own signature gameplay element that makes it stand out. You'll remember \"We Don't Go To Ravenholm\" from \"Route Kanal\" from \"Follow Freeman!\" because they are so distinct from one another.\r\n\r\nThe added beauty of this 20th Anniversary update is the inclusion of Half-Life Episode 1 & 2 all in one title. There is not enough to say about such a foundational title like Half-Life 2, you simply need to play it and then wait with the rest of us for the day Valve graces us with the 3rd installment we have wanted for 18 years now.", "timestamp_created": 1736621098, "timestamp_updated": 1736621098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0,

But if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIngredients\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar\n3/4 cup sugar\n2 large eggs\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n3/4 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon fine salt\n\nDirections\n1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)\n\n2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.\n\n3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.\n\n4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.\n\n5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.\n\nFor a Rocky Road Bar:\n1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1685846049, "timestamp_updated": 1733075640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765829026699066162",

Enemies barely react when you shoot them, so it feels like you\u2019re just dumping bullets into sponges. Sprinting is way too fast, and you wouldn't need it if the maps were designed differently. Crouching is janky, and the weapon animations look off, especially the reloads, they don\u2019t even change when reloading from empty or mid-mag.\n\n\nThe gun sounds are TERRIBLE, and the way weapons move just looks stiff and weird, especially compared to something like [b]Halo CE[/b], which came out earlier and did it WAY better.\n\n\nThe AI is [u]dumb and basic[/u], even compared to older games like [b]Halo[/b], [b]FEAR[/b], or even the original [b]Doom[/b], where enemies actually had some strategy and felt alive.\n\n\n[b]Half-Life[/b] also does a bad job of telling you where to go and it\u2019s easy to get lost, making some parts frustrating instead of fun. (you cannot tell me you haven't searched up a solution on YouTube)\n\n\nThe textures are ugly and look like someone took pictures of random walls, downscaled it and slapped them in the game. the shadows are blurry, the bloom looks atrocious: the game looks better with it turned off, and everything has this weird yellow tint.\n\n\nand on top of that they didn\u2019t bother adding effects that already existed at the time, like [b][i]depth of field[/i][/b], [b]lens flare[/b], [b]ambient occlusion[/b], [b]motion blur[/b], [b]good reflections[/b] and [b]cubemaps [/b]making everything look even flatter and more outdated..\n\n\nThe \"cutscenes\" are also awkward, Games like [b]COD4[/b] keep you in first-person but still manage to make them feel cinematic. While [b]Half Life 2[/b] just has you standing around while characters move like robots (the animators didn't even try).\n\n\nAnd the story basically boils down to \"go here, now go there, oh look, something happens,\" without much depth to it.\n\n\n[b]And for people saying it \"holds up graphically,\" it really doesn\u2019t.[/b]\n\n\nGames like [b]GTA V[/b], [b]Watch Dogs 1[/b], [b]Mirror\u2019s Edge[/b], [b]Portal 2[/b], [b]Far Cry 3[/b] & [b]4[/b], [b]Assassin\u2019s Creed 1[/b], [b]BioShock[/b], and [b]Dead Space[/b] all look way better and actually aged well. Half-Life, though? Not so much. Then there\u2019s the community, which is just obsessed with Half-Life 3 despite Valve already addressing that they won\u2019t release it unless they have new tech to show. Instead of accepting this, they keep milking the game forever, playing 50 different mods, making weird character ships, and acting like it\u2019s the greatest game ever when there are way better titles on the market.", "timestamp_created": 1741660748, "timestamp_updated": 1741660997, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423028171062469482", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "189917675", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086065063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 175, "playtime_at_review": 1074, "last_played": 1741560398}, "language": "english", "review": "Valve showed the way of how a game must be", "timestamp_created": 1741660913, "timestamp_updated": 1741660913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "189916221", "author": {"steamid": "76561199265655679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1739591815}, "language": "english", "review": "Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman\n\nRise and shine...\n\nNot that I wish to imply that you have been sleeping on the job.

Released in 2004 by Valve, it remains one of the most perfectly crafted experiences in gaming history. Every element\u2014gameplay, storytelling, physics, pacing, and atmosphere\u2014comes together seamlessly, creating an experience that feels as fresh today as it did on release.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary Physics and Gameplay\r\nAt the heart of Half-Life 2\u2019s brilliance is its physics system, powered by the Source engine. The introduction of realistic object interaction wasn\u2019t just a technical marvel; it became an integral part of gameplay. The Gravity Gun remains one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming, turning everyday objects into deadly tools. Whether you're solving puzzles, manipulating the environment, or flinging saw blades at enemies, the physics feel organic and intuitive.\r\n\r\nMasterful Storytelling Without Cutscenes\r\nUnlike many narrative-driven games, Half-Life 2 tells its story without breaking player immersion. There are no traditional cutscenes\u2014everything unfolds in real-time, with the world reacting naturally to your presence. The silent protagonist, Gordon Freeman, allows players to step fully into the role, making every moment feel personal. The characters, from the enigmatic G-Man to the lovable Alyx Vance, feel alive, thanks to top-tier voice acting and animation.\r\n\r\nPerfectly Paced and Varied Gameplay\r\nHalf-Life 2 is a masterclass in pacing. The game never lingers too long on one mechanic, environment, or enemy type. One moment, you\u2019re fighting Combine soldiers in dystopian city streets, the next, you\u2019re navigating the terrifying zombie-infested halls of Ravenholm. Then, you're speeding across coastal highways, engaging in physics-based puzzles, or leading a resistance assault. Every section offers something new, keeping players engaged from start to finish.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric and Immersive World\r\nCity 17 is one of gaming\u2019s most iconic settings. From the moment you step off the train, you feel the oppression of the Combine\u2019s rule. The environments tell a story of a world that has already lost, filled with surveillance, propaganda, and fear. The art direction, sound design, and music work together to create a truly immersive experience that lingers long after you\u2019ve finished the game.\r\n\r\nLegacy and Influence\r\nHalf-Life 2 didn't just push the boundaries of gaming\u2014it redefined them. Its physics system, environmental storytelling, and seamless blend of action and narrative influenced countless games that followed.

mods. Even Titanfall 2 runs on source. So, hugely important for gaming as a whole. But does that mean that HL2 itself is good?It is ,,the best game of all time\" as some people claim? For me absolutely not. For me, it is not even good. Playing HL2 feels like a chore from beginning to end. Having fun is the exception. What kept me playing is just seeking the feeling of accomplishement when finishing a level. Because lets look at this objectively; HL2 is a hugely linear game with very little freedom to do your own way. It is a linear shooter with physics, broken up by the occasional puzzle. In combat, you can shoot enemies and shoot red barrels. Theres the gravity gun aswell but that really just adds the step of grabbing your ammo before you shoot. The gunplay itself feels uninspired. The weapons have no kick and give little feedback. The physics puzzles always have just one solution to them. That doesnt make me feel like the game has a great physics engine, which im learning to understand and exploit, it makes me feel like im being given the illusion of intellectual accomplishment while execution something the devs hardcoded in. So i dont get why some people classify this as an immersive sim either. Another things that makes HL2 boring to me is the levels. You explore depressing appartment blocks and decaying everyday infrastructure. One of the reasons i enjoyed HL1 so much was that the setting was just so cool. You were exploring the insides of nuclear reactors, teleportation labs, and rocket launchsites. It just made you want to see more and moer of black mesa. HL2 couldnt be different.

You play as Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist whose greatest achievement isn\u2019t quantum mechanics, but surviving an alien invasion with nothing but a crowbar and sheer determination.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Pros:[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Revolutionary physics engine: Who needs a Nobel Prize when you can use a gravity gun to turn everyday junk into deadly projectiles? Turns out, physics is way more fun when it involves hurling saw blades at enemies.\n[*] Immersive storytelling: The game doesn\u2019t spoon-feed you lore\u2014you piece it together while dodging bullets, solving puzzles, and questioning every cryptic word from the G-Man.\n[*] Alyx Vance: The best companion you could ask for\u2014brilliant, resourceful, and effortlessly charming. Honestly, she carries the emotional weight of the story better than Gordon ever could.\n[*] City 17: A masterclass in dystopian world-building. Oppressive yet fascinating, every corner tells a story of resistance and despair.\n[*] The Gravity Gun: Because why settle for bullets when you can turn a radiator into a weapon of mass destruction?\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Cons:[/h2]\n[list]\n[*] Gordon Freeman's personality: A man of action, a legend among men\u2026 and yet, mute as a brick.\n[*] Headcrabs: Small, screeching nightmares that exist solely to test your reflexes (and your heart rate).\n[*] Cliffhanger ending: It\u2019s been 20 years, Valve. We\u2019re still here. We\u2019re still waiting. Half-Life 3? No? Okay.\n[*] Gravity Gun addiction: Once you\u2019ve launched a toilet at an enemy, traditional weapons just feel\u2026 underwhelming.\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Life Lessons:[/h2]\nHalf-Life 2 isn\u2019t just a game\u2014it\u2019s a crash course in adaptability. You\u2019re thrown into a world that doesn\u2019t wait for you to figure things out. No tutorials, no hand-holding. Just you, your instincts, and whatever junk you can weaponize. It teaches you that sometimes, life won\u2019t give you a clear path. You\u2019ll have to improvise, trust yourself, and, when all else fails\u2014swing a crowbar and hope for the best.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Final Thoughts:[/h2]\nHalf-Life 2 is a masterpiece that redefined gaming, blending storytelling, innovation, and action into an unforgettable experience. Two decades later, it still holds up\u2014just like Gordon\u2019s HEV suit, which, miraculously, has never needed dry cleaning.\n\nRating: 10/10 \u2013 A timeless classic.

pretty good game\n\nedit: ok so i've finished ep 1 and 2 now so here are my thoughts\ni find this game weird because it might be the only game i ever played which i like but which didnt hook me in. what i mean is that for example when i played terraria, at first i didnt really understand what was going on or what i was supposed to do. however after some time of playing i finally got the hang of it and i started enjoying the game very much and i would play it every day. i would be constantly thinking about it, what i should do next etc.\nthis didnt happen with hl2. it might be because i wanted to play hl and hl2 to clear my backlog but i certainly think thats not it because i really find this game to be really good. the graphics still hold up very well imo, the physics and the gravity gun are amazing, the puzzles and the way the game forces you into putting yourself in gordons shoes to find the solution is what made me realize this game is different(also available for hl1), and the story is also really good. however it still didnt hook me like terraria, dying light, dead cells, etc. did.\n\ni think something that this game does 100x times better than the first game are characters. having characters that remain until the end of the game makes the story way much better and gives you something to attach to. im not sure if what im saying makes sense but i think you can get the picture.\n\nall in all this game is absolutely amazing and watching the 20 year documentary makes me appreciate it even more.", "timestamp_created": 1738700742, "timestamp_updated":

In 2004, it set new standards for the entire industry. If the first game was a revolution, the second one was its triumph. Here\u2019s why:\n\nPros:\n\nPhysics: The Source Engine showed for the first time that physics in games could be more than just decoration \u2014 it could be part of the gameplay. The gravity gun is genius.\n\nStory and World: City 17, the Combine, the mysterious G-Man \u2014 it all creates an atmosphere you want to explore.\n\nGraphics: For its time, it was photorealistic. Even now, the game holds up well.\n\nGameplay: A great mix of shooting, puzzles, and atmospheric moments.\n\nCons:\n\nEnding: Again, it leaves more questions than answers. But maybe that\u2019s a good thing?\n\nBoat Mission: A bit too long, but it\u2019s a minor flaw.\n\nVerdict: Half-Life 2 is a must-play for anyone who calls themselves a gamer. It\u2019s like \"The Dark Knight\" of video games. If you haven\u2019t played it yet, what are you even doing with your life?\n\nP.S.

It has broken the game. After this new update was released, I played it through again (I've played Half-Life 2 & Episodes through far times than I can count in my life) to see the update's changes and I encountered three new bugs which I've never experience before in all 20 years of Half-Life 2's existence:\n\n1. The teleporter in chapter \"Entanglement\" bugs out once it is ready to teleport Freeman & Alex out of the Nova Prospekt prison. The trigger will often not engage when Freeman steps onto the platform after Alex is already on board.\n\n2. Barnacles in Half-Life 2 no longer die when they eat poison headcrabs. Whether this bug is accidental or, God forbid, is a deliberate change which would be an act of historical vandalism and removal of a really fascinating, realistic and nice detail, I don't know. Why can't people just leave gates the way they found them and not make change just for the sake of change? I only encountered this bug in the Half-Life 2 main/first game but not with the barnacles in the episodes which suggests it is an unintended bug. I certainly hope that is the case and if so, it needs to be fixed.\n\n3. The game crashed with repeating audio just after the encounter with the Advisor in the shed in chapter \"Riding Shotgun\" in Half-Life Episode 2. Again, I have never encountered these kinds of problems in Half-Life 2 in all 20 years prior to this update.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is one of the greatest, most reliable and well developed FPS games ever with developer workmanship that would run rings around the shoddy workmanship of the development teams of most triple A games today. It has never ceased in its premiership but it took a 2024 development team to screw it up.\n\nValve development team: fix these problems ASAP with a follow up patch. You made a great product that is Half-Life 2 that will endure in respect & popularity for all time so don't screw it up now.

Instead of a contemporary product, we used to see it like the standard because it was the first thing we received.\r\n\r\nI played the first game back in February but had to drop it as I was burnt out after reaching 60%. Even though I also can't review that one according to the standards of 1998 for the same reason, still, it was obvious that it was a fun retro game that was definitely still playable today. Although I don't know how many times HL2 got overhauled over 20 years, it's obvious that everything you can think of is a massive improvement over the first title. Alongside the semi open-world and bringing a much more immersive experience, what this game does the best is the massive improvement over the modelling and texture quality. And not just the first title, everything in this game is beyond its era and if I was told this game came out in the PS3 or early PS4 era, I would believe it.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, HL games are exhausting compared to other FPS games. However, it also gives the same amount of joy. Does it have any annoying bits? Of course! For instance, I got annoyed by the game constantly throwing helicopters at us as boss fights and the overall movement feeling slippery as if we're ice-skating. Even though the latter might be overlooked as it's an old game, is the first one enough to make this game bad or mid? Absolutely not!\r\n\r\nDefinitely still playable in 2025.\r\n\r\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1736447057, "timestamp_updated": 1736447057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "185197982", "author": {"steamid": "76561199081418610", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 490, "last_played": 1739472644}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game is amazing and a timeless classic, i do believe that the airboat section, and the jalopy sections in the base game and episode 2 respectively go on a little too long, i also believe that the acid antlions are utter bullshit.", "timestamp_created": 1736445688, "timestamp_updated": 1736445688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "185197812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300565262", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 98, "playtime_at_review": 14816, "last_played": 1741707184}, "language": "english", "review": "Rise and shine, Mister Freeman.

As someone who grew up during the original Half-Life era, I\u2019m certainly no stranger to the series, yet this sequel felt like a jumbled mess of aimless events, disconnected characters, and a story that seems to pull its plot from a hat. \n\nThe narrative, which is supposed to be the heart of Half-Life 2, is anything but coherent. It\u2019s a patchwork of disjointed scenarios and random characters that offer little in terms of explanation or engagement.  What\u2019s happening here? Why is this happening? And who are these people? For all its grandeur, the story feels like a scattered puzzle where the pieces don\u2019t fit. And no, I didn\u2019t skip the first game, yet the connection between them seems tenuous at best. \n\nOne of the standout frustrations is the glade boat section, a lengthy, drawn-out sequence that felt entirely unnecessary and, frankly, infuriating. It\u2019s a giant time-sink, seemingly designed to test your patience rather than engage you. Then there\u2019s the bizarre Soviet-style setting, yet with American influences peppered throughout. The constant barrage of enemies, often respawning for no reason at all, further drags down the experience. Why are these enemies appearing? What purpose do they serve? These unanswered questions pile up, making the game feel like it\u2019s filled with action for action\u2019s sake, rather than a meaningful narrative progression.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is the pretentious nature of the whole thing. Half-Life 2 seems to be one of those games that tries to mask its emptiness under the guise of obscure meaning, making you feel inadequate for not \u201cgetting it.\u201d The truth is, there\u2019s nothing deep to uncover here.

Every piece of diolauge i can remember from heart even each action\n\n\nIt never gets old and i keep learning new tricks every time i play even today, and it is still addictive. The game is completely seamless from beginning to end, never interrupting the flow and you are completely in control THE entire time where the game never takes it away from you, bet you never thought about that huh. And the fact you went from beginning to end on your own in a single seamless run with no loading screens, the game didn't tell you that you did that all yourself \n\n\n\nThe commentary nodes, i would listen to these for hours repeating it seeing how the game works, i never thought about it at the time but that's how i learned game development in perfect detail\n\n\n\nGordon is only on the box, you never see him once the entire game and neither is there a model of him atleast not in that form and is the most iconic character of all time. I remember my brother told me you never see him in game and i started looking at windows to see my reflection and never once saw a glimpse of him\n\n\nHad my first ever rage in a game and it was at the twin gunship fight at Nova Prospekt, that shit made me angry and i was like 10 or 12. I have no idea how i got through this entire game because it is genuinely hard\n\n\nOnly part i don't like in all of HL2 is the uprising chapters, like good god they could've done better but rushed the shit out of them for some reason, the strider fights are not fun at all and there is barely any cover for something so massive that the Strider ends up killing me in like 3 shots, it is not fun at all and with a anti climatic ending to go with it, thank god for the episodes because if the game ended right here, it's a unfinished mess of a final area\n\n\n\n11/10 - Spent every waking hour playing the game to death", "timestamp_created": 1528174488, "timestamp_updated": 1742643328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190875780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086392939", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2283, "playtime_at_review": 2166, "last_played": 1742650237}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Game EVER", "timestamp_created": 1742636303, "timestamp_updated": 1742636303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190874630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067646057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 552, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1742677865}, "language": "english", "review": "over 20 years old and still no other single player fps doesn't match it", "timestamp_created": 1742635151, "timestamp_updated": 1742635151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190873123", "author": {"steamid": "76561199664831319", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 268, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1742688359}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1742633548, "timestamp_updated": 1742633548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190870459", "author": {"steamid": "76561199716318610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1742632607}, "language": "english", "review": "s", "timestamp_created": 1742630435, "timestamp_updated": 1742630435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "106356838", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014502995", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1736454817}, "language": "english", "review": "Oldschool", "timestamp_created": 1640269202, "timestamp_updated": 1742627323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "176861714", "author": {"steamid": "76561199403730178", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 1411, "last_played": 1742128346}, "language": "english", "review": "Goo goo ga ga...I want...I want milk.", "timestamp_created": 1728697098, "timestamp_updated": 1742626396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190865362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137080802", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 712, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1742681582}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Half-Life 2.

The movement is junky\u2014climbing ladders, jumping, and overall it feels weird to me. Soundtrack is also not great, in my opinion. It's alright, but forgettable. \nNow let's move on to the good stuff. The world created in HL2 is absolutely amazing. I think it's one of the best sci-fi worlds ever. It's more gritty than I remembered it from an original playthrough from 2004. Also, the lore is rally reach if you're willing to dig through. The design of City 17, combined units, and the Citadel are simply amazing. It's less impressive when it comes to the open-ended locations, at least in the original game (in Episode 2, they look much better). The graphics hold up even today, and they're the best from the big 3 from 2004 (HL2, Doom 3 and Far Cry). Too bad it ends with such a cliffhanger, but I still hope they'll move the story forward in one way or another.

Ah, one more, the \"GMAN\" He seems interesting but due to the fact that we have a limited amount of content and no conclusion it just hasn't payed off well in my opinion. \n\n2: The Gameplay is not very good. AR2 = SMG but with a better altfire and less radius. I understand that restricting your weaponry could've been necessary for the \"groundbreaking\" physics to occur and work properly. but what the fuck is the gravity gun, then? That gun is more technical then your ENTIRE arsenal! And it's unusable in certain areas anyway! The pistol is dogshit, the revolver is good and is so the rest of them but they sound so weak. No impact, no oomph, that style for lack of better words. Enemies are very bland. Combine there and combine here. Antlions are a one trick pony. Zombies have nothing special. Everything else I forgot about besides the big machines. The only good enemy in this game isn't even here, it's in EP2. It's the Hunter. Which, let me remind you, EP2 did not progress the story enough for it to be considered a valid push for the story. \n\n3: The \"Physics\" AREN'T groundbreaking, shut up. Psi Ops, did it better. Hitman (Blood Money, IIRC) did it better. TRESPASSER, which came out YEARS before did the same exact thing. Max Payne 2, and many more ALREADY had the physics! This is nothing new! The gameplay was better in those games and was more consistent anyway! This game tried so much and failed because it wasn't ever meant to be a game, it's a lazy tech demo that was pushed and rushed out. Cutting years of work because of a poor storyline, and overall bad game design. Fuck anybody who says this game is revolutionary. \n\nI think I have had my fair share of this crock of lousy and loud shite. It's got a little something for everyone, and by that, I mean that it has 1 tiny crumb. Good luck eating that, ya glazers.", "timestamp_created": 1742587886, "timestamp_updated": 1742587886, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434782594442367554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190828816", "author": {"steamid": "76561199094380267", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1354, "playtime_at_review": 1466, "last_played": 1742594172}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1742586351, "timestamp_updated": 1742586351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190825588", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208507772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 285, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1742622867}, "language": "english", "review": "cool", "timestamp_created": 1742583818, "timestamp_updated": 1742583818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190823448", "author": {"steamid": "76561199562574224", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 740, "last_played": 1739095685}, "language": "english", "review": "\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Game Size }---\n\u2610 Floppy Disk\n\u2611 Old Fashioned\n\u2610 Workable\n\u2610 Big\n\u2610 Will eat 15% of your 1TB hard drive\n\u2610 You will want an entire hard drive to hold it\n\u2610 You will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

Standing or moving while shooting them didn\u2019t change the fact that you would take a lot of damage while trying to deal damage to them. The best way to resolve this issue was to one-shot them, so weapons like the crossbow, the alternate fire of the laser gun, and the alternate fire of the SMG and magnum were essential for dealing with human soldiers in Half-Life 1. This problem is even more apparent on Hard difficulty.\n\nWhy am I talking about Half-Life 1 when this is about Half-Life 2, which came out six years later? Well, because nothing changed in Half-Life 2. Guns have random spray patterns\u2014nothing was learned from Counter-Strike or Counter-Strike: Source, which had fixed spray patterns and recoil. One-tapping, burst fire, and crouching do not improve accuracy, or at least not noticeably enough.\n\nWeapon and enemy variety is also reduced. Some aliens from Half-Life 1 don\u2019t even appear, but there\u2019s an abundance of: cop with a gun, cop with an SMG, cop with some s**t that\u2019s the same as an SMG, cop with a shotgun\u2026 boring. Half-Life 2 also came out after Call of Duty 1 (2003), which had amazing recoil mechanics and the option to shoot from the hip or aim down sights. But HL2 still used outdated shooting mechanics from the \u201890s.\n\nStill, I love Half-Life to the moon and back, but Half-Life and Valve are a cancer. They ruined us. They experimented with episodic releases, so we got HL2: Episode 1 and Episode 2\u2014and then we never got Episode 3. For 18 years, we\u2019ve been following leak after leak, rumor after rumor. It\u2019s been so sad and frustrating. And when Half-Life: Alyx came out, I didn\u2019t play it\u2014I don\u2019t have the equipment for it\u2014but I watched a playthrough. At the end, when you hear the HEV suit and see from Gordon Freeman\u2019s perspective, I cried so much. That\u2019s when I realized how much Half-Life meant to me and how much pain and suffering I had gone through over these 18 years.\n\nThe Valve we knew is dead. They\u2019re making tons of money from Steam, and their technical support is absolute trash\u2014because they can be. Steam is the number one game-selling platform on Earth, and nothing comes close. At least we got Epistle Three in 2022, 15 years after Half-Life 2: Episode 3 was canceled and became Half-Life 3, which was also canceled multiple times.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never played Half-Life 2, should you play it? No. Even for free. The game has been unfinished for 18 years now. And it\u2019s even worse knowing that if HL2: Episode 3 or Half-Life 3 ever does come out, it won\u2019t follow the story from Epistle Three\u2014which sucks, because that story was amazing. I mean, even if Half-Life 3 was free, it wouldn\u2019t make up for the s**t we\u2019ve been through for the past 18 years.\n\nAlso, Alyx came out five fing years ago**, so that ending that made me cry? Well, it was five fing years ago**, and still\u2014no Episode 3, no Half-Life 3. I don\u2019t know what kind of apology, what kind of game they could make\u2014even if they made it free\u2014and I still don\u2019t know if I can ever truly forgive them for what they did to us for the past 18 years.", "timestamp_created": 1742251881, "timestamp_updated": 1742505528, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460526347160339355", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "190740967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410083854", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 611, "playtime_at_review": 605, "last_played": 1742601539}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life 2 Is amazing.
