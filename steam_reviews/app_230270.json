The developer of that level was more concerned with making a \"cool\" looking level rather than a functioning one. This is one of many examples and it is mind wrenching that they would allow levels like that to make it to the final product. \n\nThe momentum based jumps feel arbitrary and RNG based with barely any player control. Levels will stick gold in very questionable spaces that feel more like a way to recycle content than to keep a player challenged, and half the time the \"Challenge\" seems more like you are just rolling the dice every life to collect all the gold , for there are too many factors in place to stay alive in such a hectic environment. You will die many many times with no lesson learned and the game feels like it is hard to just BE hard, with no system in place for real improvement. This is obviously based on the levels you are playing, however.  \n\nThe main issue with this game is the momentum based movement is very rewarding when pulled off but the developer made levels that slow the pace down to a screeching halt and make the player slow down in an environment meant to be quick.\n\n I mean for F&%^'s sake the story is about a FAST ninja.

Every mistake is your own fault. \n\nIt was fun flying through the regular completion of levels and then they started getting harder, taking minutes to figure out, then eventually i'd hit some really hard levels that took hours. These hard levels start every single time, with me going THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE, but every 10 minutes that passed, I notice myself getting better and better and more perfect on pulling off the movement that I learned to eventually beat the stage. The longer the grind to learn a level, the more nervewracking then satisfying it is when I pull it off.\n\nAnd the challenge system too, it's so brilliantly integrated... such an easy addition per level from the game designer, instantly gives each level 2 to 10 times as much replay value. I can choose on a play session to progress uncleared levels, to progress cleared levels i need full gold on, or to progress gold levels I need the challenges on. And then those completions unlock yet even more levels that are on their own godly tier.\n\nSeriously man.

If you know the classic N, N++ offers the same and more.\n\nThe good:  Most of the hard-as-nails platformers that proliferated in the 00's are derived in some way from this game, at least on the surface.  Speed, jumping, walljumping, wallsliding, and dodging deadly traps.  It doesn't get any purer than the N formula.  No frills, no secrets, no anything but solid action.  There are awards for acquiring all the gold and beating an entire 25-room episode on a single timebar.  Several additional play modes, such as co-op and race, enhance the experience.  The I/O performance is also excellent, lacking the random frame drops of the earlier Flash versions.\n\nThe bad:  The same as the good.  No frills, no secrets, and incredibly frustrating difficulty at times.  The shear amount of content (i.e. extremely difficult content) means this one will frustrate even completionists.  For less-skilled players, the need for beating five rooms at once in order to advance means the game will infuriate those who can't beat just one room in the set.  Also, once you've played some of N, there isn't much more to it.  What you see is all you'll ever get.\n\nAs stated, the 'bad' is sparse, while the 'good' is thick.

N++ is the third installment of the \"N\" series which started as a flash game in 2004. Each level takes place on one screen and the player has to acquire a key, and then navigate to the level's exit before the time limit runs out. The only way to increase the time limit is to collect gold scattered around the level. While the one screen limit may seem too restrictive, the developers have done a great job of cramming them full with challenging but fair obstacles to overcome. Each enemy or obstacle will always have a pattern or clearly be telegraphed. The player will have to complete an \"episode\" which comprises of five levels before they can unlock even more levels to beat. There are literally hundreds of levels to play (not to mention the additional multiplayer episodes with a plethora of different modes to chose from) and with the built in level editor, players will never run out of stuff to do. But something that'll keep you playing until the end is N++'s razor sharp controls. Maneuvering through each level is a joy since you control your character so effortlessly, although momentum is something you must keep in mind. Meaning if you don't have enough speed while climbing up a wall or clearing a large gap, while not impossible, will pose to be more difficult. Overall N++ is a magnificent platformer with loads of content to enjoy, and not to mention tons of secrets to find.

Good god, time really flies. I knew I had to instantly buy this on launch to support the developers, as a thank you for all the free entertainment years ago.\n\nThe original Flash version kept me entertained for hours on end...to be more specific, it's a combination of euphoria and frustration. But usually frustration. \nSpecifically, frustration at my own lack of skill. This game requires a lot of precision, even more so than [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/]Super Meat Boy[/url], in my honest opinion. But the euphoria experienced from finally beating one of those almighty challenging levels is just incredible.\n\nFloaty ninja jumping, sweet walljumping, amazing physics engine. Seriously - this has the best physics engine I've ever experienced in any 2D game ever. Maybe even 3D? I don't know if I want to go that far.\nThose were key aspects to its underground cult following back then - these are key aspects in its successful sequels today. N+ and N++ helped to fine tune and overly polish the experience.\n\nNo online multiplayer? I don't see this as a problem. The original N never had any online multiplayer. N+ had it, but it would be a challenge to implement here because of latency and whatnot interfering negatively with the physics, that I can recognise. As a compromise, there is local multiplayer.\n\nA vastly challenging experience, not for the faint-hearted (and that is about the only possible con I see in this, that the difficulty could put off the most casual gamers). A LOT of handcrafted levels (and even more user-created levels). Great colour palettes. Brilliant licensed soundtrack that just about fits the mood of the game and whatever you're experiencing right now.\n\nIt is no wonder that this game was instantly deserving of my nomination for the \"I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\" award.

For the most part, this is a fantastic edition of a fantastic core game.\n\nN++ is an energetic platformer that focuses on momentum above all else. Your score bleeds away every second and collecting gold increases the score. Technically if you run out of time you lose, but I have yet to encounter any levels that make that the serious threat it was in the original game.\n\nMost levels are less about whether or not you can complete the challenge (though some levels are hard enough for that to be a struggle) and more about how efficiently you can complete it. Few games have as engaging a sense of motion for me. This game captures the exhiliration of movement as well as a digital game can, and does so in two dimensions with minimalist artwork. It is an outstanding acheivement.\n\nThe soundtrack is hit and miss for me, but the wide variety of artists and tracks is impressive and when it hits it *really* hits. The interface is slick, the color skins are slick, the presentation is all around top-class though it would be nice to have a few more ways to view the leaderboards more arbitrarily.\n\nAnd now we come to my few complaints. Perhaps I'm suffering from selective memory but I feel like I encountered a wider variety of challenges and a wider mix of enemy types across playing the original levels. User-made levels can help make up for this, and there's a tightness of composition to the levels that really shines in places ... but sometimes that same tightness makes it that much clearer how to efficiently move through the level. More levels now feel like pure rote practice as opposed to having a bit of exploration and experimentation followed by rote practice to get the method you discovered down. Perhaps I've just played too muhc N, but I can figure out most of the tricks to the new levels the second the level starts and there are fewer \"aha\" moments as I encounter the weird quirks of the level's design at exactly the wrong moment.\n\nOn the one hand there are also fewer filler levels of just collecting gold pieces and going to the exit without substantive threat ... but on the other hand I've never found myself pressed for time in the later levels of an episode because I didn't do the earlier levels efficiently enough and that feels like as much a loss as a gain. Further, many levels that would otherwise occupy that filler level space in the original game merely add a rocket launcher or a chaser to make things significantly more challenging without being significantly more interesting.\n\nBut those are minor issues and I can fix them by jumping back to the original whenever I feel like it or by exploring user-made levels for either edition of the game.

With the tech available to game developers now, one would think there'd almost be an expectation to make hyper-realistic and fluidly animated third-person cover shooters that probably only run at a cinematic 24 frames per second on most computers. The appeal of a 2D platformer is that it is - and almost always will be - extremely self-explanatory. Upon launching N++, it will take most people under 30 seconds to have everything figured out. It's the age-old mantra of 'easy to learn, hard to master' that so many genres will simply never be able to get right.\n\nThat said, it could be argued that the reason [i]N++[/i] is so simple to learn is because of its apparent fear of doing anything to differentiate it from the rest of the genre as a whole. To hone in on the problem, one should look to the previous instalments of the series. Originating as a free 2004 browser game, simply titled [url=http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/nv2.html][i]N[/i][/url], the title was later released as on Xbox Live Arcade as [i]N+[/i], including the addition of a well-received online multiplayer component. With the release of [i]N++[/i], it becomes pretty clear that developer Metanet Software isn't going to budge. The obscure titling begs the question: is this a sequel or a remake? The fact that all the levels are different per game says sequel, but the fact that the gameplay is perfectly identical screams 'stand-alone DLC'. Which is truthfully what [i]N++[/i] probably should have been. It shows no characteristics of an entirely new game, and doesn't feel like a great investment if you've already played the previous two games.\n\nBy itself, [i]N++[/i] is a great game. The gameplay is smooth and the minimal graphic style is sleek and professional. As with the previous games, it strikes a solid balance between fair and frustrating, and the local multiplayer modes are a blast with friends, including a tough-as-nails co-op mode in which both players are all but required to play at peak performance to complete the specifically designed levels. Race mode is by far the most enjoyable, as it lends an element of speedy precision that's missing from the solo levels thanks to a jump button so floaty that it's practically a feature.\n\nThe acclaimed online multiplayer is notably absent this time around, and criticism by fans was met with excuses stinking of the procrastinatory air that hangs over the product. It feels like the words 'can't be bothered' must have been uttered frequently during development, because it is quite literally a shiny new coat over an 11-year-old game that can still be played for free online.

Years later, I think around 2010, I had pretty much forgotten about it. However, while browsing my local GameStop, I noticed a small DS game called N+. I immediately remembered my time playing the original flash game, and picked that box up to bring to the counter immediately. It was full of great danger, a tough challenge, and even had the original flash graphics as an option (or at least a replica that the DS could actually pull off). I spent hours on that game, and it's still one of my favorite DS games, and what I considered the gold standard of pure platformers.\n\nNow we have another N game, which I immediately jumped on the opportunity to buy the second I found out about it (by selling a bunch of TF2 and Dota stuff that I don't use). I'll be comparing this to N+ DS a lot since that's the one I have the most experience with, so when I mention N+, it'll be referencing the DS version and not the PSP or 360.\n\nI am definitely enjoying this game so far, and for the sake of information, I'll repeat the same shit everyone else has said. The controls are dead on, I use an Xbox 360 controller to play and it reads all my button inputs perfectly. It's a bit annoying that I can only navigate menus with the D-Pad since gameplay and the level editor allow/require the joystick(s) respectively.\n\nThe music is nice, though I found myself having to mute it after a while due to the style while wearing headphones. It's not the music's fault, I just get a headache if I listen to that kind of pumping EDM stuff for too long, so I play with headphones off. It would be awesome if I could add in music from my own library or if the music from all the versions of N+ (but mainly the DS version ^_^) were in the game as unlockables, or even DLC if need be (I'd pay for the DS music in a heartbeat).\n\nThe legacy episodes are nice too. I noticed a few levels from N+ on the in some of the episodes I haven't unlocked yet, though with the physics being closer to the original N than N+.\n\nNow for my gripes:\n\n- No Tag or Domination multiplayer modes for us DS ninjas. I loved Domination in N+ and I'd love to see it return so I could do that without needing someone else to have their own game card. I have no real problem with no online multiplayer since I don't care much for online in a game like this. If it gets added in at some point, that's all well and good, but I just want my Domination mode back. :'(\n\n- The initially ran slower on my computer than it should, but I was able to fix it. Apparently turning off V-Sync fixes the problem, though it didn't initially work for me. I ended up fumbling with the window size a bit, and when I re-fullscreened it, [b]BAM![/b] Glorious full speed. \n\n- This is pretty minor, but the level editor has a lot fewer possible blocks than the DS version. Seriously, the kinds of shapes you can create in N+ DS is crazy. I actually tried to re-create one of my old custom levels and I had to make a lot of changes because the shapes I used don't exist in this version.\n\n- To my knowledge, you can't set the graphics to the original flash graphics, I just don't see the same charm in these new graphics that I do in the simple flash graphics. I had similar feeling towards the Plus graphics in the DS version, but I could swap to the original graphics in that. Some of color schemes are also a bit too colorful for my tastes, but there are enough of them to mitigate that issue.\n\nOther than those, this game turned out pretty good. I'll probably update this review later and give a much more informed opinion after I've cleared at least half the episodes. I still like N+ more, but once I've spent more time on this game, that opinion has a chance to change.\n\nEDIT: Still like the DS version more, but this is still damn good.", "timestamp_created": 1472596259, "timestamp_updated": 1479951318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541607916355133057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "26977098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025203905", "num_games_owned": 1703, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1691611599}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will test your urge to put your fist through your monitor....", "timestamp_created": 1479950953, "timestamp_updated": 1479950953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "26947340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176352471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1144, "last_played": 1643340861}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Fun yet super hard.\nHas a good level editor.\n\nNuff Said", "timestamp_created": 1479944423, "timestamp_updated": 1479944423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "26925511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045769784", "num_games_owned": 584, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1709432456}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth it.\n\nI remember playing the original N a few years back and lost many hours to it then.

The game was pretty special back then since it was made in flash, yet it was so well made and content rich that it could of passed as a AAA title at the time. Flash forward to 2016 with the release of N++ and it still holds strong as being one of the best platformers out there.\n\nN++ is the best version of N, being the most polished and content rich of the series, but what makes this game truely special is something that has existed since the first version of N, that being its very well executed movement mechanics. N was a game that focused purely on platforming, there's basically no story, no abilities, no player gimmicks, no killing enemies (they're are plenty of enemies to kill you however). It's just you and your ability to run, jump and wall jump.\n\nThe movement in N++ is best described as \"floaty\" which to most is a word associated with bad platformers, yet N++ some how manages to make you feel almost completely in control with it's fast, precise and complex movement system. All your actions in N++ are influenced by multiple factors including speed, momentum and even the angle of the surface you are on. As a result, N++ takes a lot of practice to master and even some of the best players still haven't mastered the movement.\n\nIf you haven't figured it out yet, N++ is hard, like really, really hard, to the point that it could be ranked as one of the most difficult games of all time. While levels start out fairly simple, they quickly become more and more difficult as the game throws more obsticles, enemies and keeps mixing and matching them to make over 4000 handcrafted levels, and most of these levels are actually carefully crafted. Which leads me to my first complaint about this game which is while the levels are for the most part pretty well made, there are a few here and there which kind of feel \"chaotic\". While everything in N++ is in theory predicable, you'll find that there are just some levels where you have to just create and memorize a pattern of movements to get past them, there is very little room for adaptation and as a result some of these levels start to feel like a chore rather than an enjoyable challenge.\n\nThe artstyle in N++ is appropriately, minimalistic with several unlockable colour palettes to change things up a bit. For the most part, the artstyle is appealing with most of the colour palettes, however there are some odd ones here and there which are terrible to look at, for example a hot pink and orange colour palette which is really painful to look at, or a palette with colours that make it hard to see some obsticles and enemies. Aside for that, the artstyle is quite appealing when the right colours are used. Also don't worry, you can change colours anytime.\n\nThe music in this game is pretty good. Most if not all of the music is chill electronic music composed by several different artists. All of the soundtracks are about equal in quality and they suit the mood and gameplay of N++. There's only 2 songs I'm not a fan of but thankfully you can change the music at anytime.\n\nAs for other features in N++, there's a full fledged level editor and browser, so there is more or less infinite levels to play (though much like games such as Mario maker there is a lot of bad levels). Also there's 4 player local coop which I haven't played, but does have it's own set of challenges centered around having 2 or more players.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of N or a fan of difficult platformers, then N++ is something I would 100% recommend to you. It offers some of the most challenging and satisfying platforming in the genre, and it has 100s, possibly 1000s of hours of content.

It was one of my favorite Flash games at the time. It was a smooth, simple, fun and quite challenging platformer, and still is. N+, which I've never played, appears to be a console and handheld version of N. \n\nNow we have N++, an improved version of N, but for modern consoles and PC, with a level editor built in. It contains an incredible amount of levels, and even (if I'm not mistaken) all classic levels from N, as well as 'Ultimate' levels. All in all we're talking thousands of levels. Tens of thousands if you include community levels.\n\nN++ is a good game, but can be frustrating at times.

It has no fat on it. There are no flaws. The only flaw in this game is the flaw you have as a player, that prevents you from beating the next level. It is all based on whether or not you can perform. Every win is proof that you can win next time. Every failure is just the first step to winning. It has style, the level names are clever and punny, manipulating enemies is gratifying. There's too much packed into this game to summarize, and nothing that shouldn't be there is present. 10/10.\n\nLEVEL EDITOR:\nEasy and simple as making pumpkin pie during the holidays. Follow the instructions, and then if you want to, get creative. The recipies for your levels are waiting for you to discover them.\n\nIRRELEVANT PERSONAL OPINION:\nThis game taught me a very important lesson about life, believe it or not. I was playing through the E-row on the N++ levels page, trying to beat them all to get to the secret levels. Every time I would start a new E-row episode, I would play through it and get to the final level absolutely furious. I could not beat the final level to these episodes. It was very frustrating at first. Many times I literally pulled my hair out. But, what I learned was this, since this game does not save your progress in episode, if you give up on the final level, you cannot continue where you left off. You have to play through the entire episode again. This taught me to finish strong, to see things through. If you give up at the end, your progress means nothing and it was all in vain. It's helping me complete my work and studies on time, to be honest.\n\nAlso, this game has a ton of nostalgia for me too, because I've been playing this game for about 8 years now, since the first flash version showed up on flash game websites. So that aspect of it is enjoyable too.\n\nTL;DR:\nThis game is the best platformer you will ever play, it tops Super Meat Boy and the original Mario and Sonic games as well.

The colors change with the themes, so your character looks very different based on the mood (and also I gotta put in that the headband looks sick lol).\n\nThe levels, at first seem easier, but get a bit harder over time.  I would say that the previous version focused more on pure skill and techinicality/precision of jumping, but this has more puzzle elements to it.  Co-op is much better as well, and now you are capable of adding 4 players instead of just 2.  \n\nI've never played with the level design, but I've heard it is very good.\n\nThe biggest reason why I like this game is because it is so relaxing and fun and a great de-stresser.

The only reason my recommendation is kind of tenuous, more of a decent to strong 6 than the 8 or 9 this game easily could have been is that the devs and I seem to disagree about what makes their game fun to play. \n\nThe best levels, in my opinion, are huge, sprawling playgrounds where the main challenge is balancing between going fast enough to outrun enemies and make gigantic, screen-clearing leaps but not gaining *so* much ninja momentum you splatter yourself on the ground when you land. There are a good handful of these, and when you have the space to improvise somewhat as you loop around and around dodging missiles and grabbing gold bricks, it feels so fun and skilful that the game is worth it for them alone. \n\nHowever, there's another broad genre of level that feels like it's designed to appeal to the absolute psychopaths who like long boss runs in Soulslikes. You see a common pattern where the level can be completed yawn-inducingly trivially if you ignore the collectables, but if you're trying to 100 percent it, there are several dozen to easily a hundred plus of them to be grabbed. This on its own I don't have a problem with. Where I draw issue is that these levels seem to be consistently balanced around the fact that let's say 95 of those collectables require 6 / 10 skill at the game to collect - you need to pay full attention but you'll get them all no problem within the first attempt or two - and then there are maybe 5 or 3 or just one little gold brick that's been lovingly placed in a spot where to collect it you need to pull off an 11 / 10 3-second long, multi-step, frame-perfect, pixel-perfect butterfly kiss with an instant death trap. That's just not an interesting form of difficulty to me. It feels like I'm emptying the dishwasher but there's exactly one fork that needs to be put away inside the mouth of a rabid wolf who lives on the divider of a 6-lane freeway. Not 100 percenting the level feels like you're not getting your money's worth or even like you're being subtly mocked because it's so easy, and actually getting there doesn't feel good because it's mostly balanced around the insanely difficult 1 percent of the level not making you so jittery or tilted you fuck up the relatively easy part you can clear in your sleep. \n\nThat said - if that kind of grind appeals to you, or you're more capable of just letting go and not feeling compelled to beat stuff like that, you'll probably love this game through and through. Even if you're like me - there is plenty here to love, plenty of levels that feel fair to lose and fun to master.

You move around in a 2D plane, as you might expect from a platfomer, but perhaps more unusually every level is contained within a single screen and as such no side-scrolling is present. Every level is a static piece of art aside from some rather deadly enemies which move according to simple and predictable rules yet are often used in deviously challenging ways.\n\nYou control a stickfigure ninja with a wealth of different moves despite only having three buttons of control - left, right and jump. This is because he interacts with the environment in a physically simulated way and the same inputs will cause different effects depending on whether you're touching a floor, a slope, a wall or nothing at all. Mastering these interactions and the changes in the player's momentum that follow is key to surviving the increasingly difficult challenges the game throws at you. \n\nAnd oh boy are there many challenges. The game sports more than 2000 levels, many of which have additional challenges that will take even the most experienced veteran of the game hours to beat. If you ever run out of official content to play (unlikely) there are also highscore leaderboards to compete on and a great level editor with online level sharing.\n\nPros:\n+the most satisfying movement mechanics in all of gaming\n+massive amount of content\n+no skill ceiling\n+welcoming community\n+beautiful visuals with lots of color options\n\nCons:\n-updates have been slow so far (as of November 2016)\n-I'm not a fan of the soundtrack\n\nConclusion: This is my favorite video game of all time.

The ninja you play as (which looks to be made out of punctuation marks in the new art style), can jump, walljump, and has a round hitbox that carries weight and preserves its momentum. The levels, albeit made from a level builder, test your ability to manipulate the physics in some in some surprising and intimate ways. \n\nAll hazards in the game either follow a set path or are reactive to your movements, giving N++ the tone of a digital sort of Pinball game, or a platformer's answer to Sudoku. These levels are packed in chunks of 4, with collectibles adding to your death timer, which is preserved.

Its fun at first, then you reach a point where it gets to hard and it no longer fun! Why play a game that feels like a chore? Games are supposed to be time-wasting fun! Not frustrating and almost impossible torture devices!\n\nEdit: I get the purpose of difficult games, but by telling somone to \"Get Gud\" or saying \"Quit crying noob\" doesn't change one's oppinion. I could find an easy as shit game and play the fuck out of that (Like I did this), and still say the game was shite. The difficulty doesn't make a game good or bad, but if the difficulty draws a player away, regardless of its difficulty, if it doesn't captive and interest a player, than that player should be obligated to determine wather or not that game was decent or not, and in this case, was it terrible? Absolutly not, it's a flawed game, I'm comparing its factor of price, total fun, and the desire to come back and play it again. This game, fails in the \"Returning\" factor. I've played Binding of Isaac, I've played Dark Soul's, now, the thing with Binding of Isaac, allthough, hard, it gets very enjoyable, and is very fun regardless. This game, is not. Now, I know Binding of Isaac has a very different game mechanic, but if you want to say \"Get Good.\" Fine, but did you enjoy it? If yes, fine! If no, Fine! All I'm saying is I have never found the desire to play this game after a troubling session. And for another example, Slime Rancher, easy as shit, but after you hit a point of maximumiazation, you're done, and you have no desire to play after that, or start over! That's all I'm saying! So, frankly, saying \"get good\" is not going to disvalue my argument. Now \"achievment.\" Sure, you feel fucking great once in a while don't you? But, there's a point where that satisfaction is lost, and you no longer enjoy victory. Going back to the easy games, even if you're a god, you get bored wrecking scrubs all day don't you? What I'm saying is, a good game is a perfect balnce of reward, skill, and other content. This game, requires a lot of  skill, fine. Reward? You get some skins.. some more levels... some more backrounds.... You don't get anything new, and content, sure there's a lot of levels, but when I mean content, I mean diverse content, content that is different. Multiuplayer: Local. Meh, its not that great of a game. Simply put it. If you think saying a game is bad because its not fun, Say its not fun. Even if that game is \"For hardcore gamers\", You have the right as a consumer to state your oppinion, obviously, you should get pretty far in the game (Which I did) To get a general taste. So, in conlusion, just because some one say's \"get gud\" doesn't make your oppinion any less valuable than others. AND THAT WHY ITS CALLED A REVIEW! I'M GIVING MY OPPINION ON A TOPIC! JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE THIS GAME DOESN'T MAKE YOU A BAD PERSON! If anything, it makes you look childish, and unwilling to listen to others if if they might have vulauble points and critisisms.

I received a reply from the developers explaining that many of those problems would be fixed in upcoming patches and the Ultimate Edition update. I removed my review and waited.\n\nYesterday I reinstalled N++ more than a year after the Ultimate Edition update was released. Once again I am disappointed that three major problems with leaderboards still exist:\n\n1. The leaderboards on several episodes have been hacked. At least one of them was hacked sometime around January 2017, and it still has not been fixed.\n\n2. Leaderboards do not consistently display player names correctly. Special characters do not work, and there is a fixed limit to how many characters a single leaderboard can display. This results in player names being truncated, or in some cases, left off entirely. \n\n3. The overall leaderboard has still not been implemented. On /r/nplusplus one of the developers claimed \"We definitely intend on adding this\" and \"this is near the top [of the priority list], after bugs.\" That was in September 2016. \n\nI will gladly switch my review to positive if the developers fix the obvious issues and implement the feature they have been promising since the game launched.", "timestamp_created": 1476970779, "timestamp_updated": 1533564704, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478270858526229858", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "43818878", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995943441", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3157, "last_played": 1671317121}, "language": "english", "review": "[quote][i]You are a reviewer.\n\nYour god-like speed, fine motor skills, typing power, and reflexes are all the result of an amazingly fun gaming experience; tragically, so is your wasted in-game time of 30+ hours.\n\nLike all reviewers, you have an unquenchable thirst for upvotes, a natural propensity for posting on forums infested by increasingly lethal self-esteem-killing trolls, and a devout belief in R.\n\nR, \"the way of the reviewer\", is a highly advanced system of spiritual, cognitive, and mental training.\n\nIt emphasizes pacifism, humility, and the need to write up a series of paragraphs before the end of your workday, a feat known only as \"writing a review\".\n\nIn accordance with the teachings of R, it is your profound hope that one day you will develop the skill, intelligence, and inexplicable ability to write [b]good[/b] necessary to attain a lot of upvotes.[/i][/quote]\n\nBack in 2005, the original [i]N[/i] was released. It was both great time killer and great platformer with simple mechanics. In 2016, [i]N++[/i] is unleashed on PC - bigger and better.\n[b][i]Mini review just for the sake of it.[/i][/b]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nEverything is simple as 95% of platformers go: you don't have any specific skills, you can run, jump, wall-jump and that's basically it. Everything depends on HOW you do it and whether you keep your momentum. Enemies range from simple mines to not so simple rocket and lazer shooting [i]turrets[/i].\nIn order to progress, you start an episode and finish every level by activating the exit and reaching it within time limit. Rules slightly change between available in-game modes, which include:\n[list]\n[*][b]Solo.[/b] Finish an episode with 5 levels before you die. Initially, you have 90 seconds, but that time can be increased by collecting gold (each piece adds 2 seconds). It's not necessary and often dangerous, but also improves your chances if you take a slow cautious aproach. Dying reset the timer to a value that you had at the start of the level allowing to retry over and over until you successed.\n[*][b]Hardcore.[/b] Mode uses the same episodes as [b]Solo[/b], but now instead of 5 levels there are 25 and everytime you die, the timer isn't reset (there are now no infinite retries of the level), and collected gold is added to the timer only once the level is complete.\n[*][b]Co-op.[/b] Same as [b]Solo[/b], except now there up to 4 players and only 1 has to reach the exit. Levels may be straight forward with both players moving in the same direction or can be divided into several isolated segments.\n[*][b]Race.[/b] Up to 4 players race to the exit to gain scores, the first one to reach the maximum wins.\n[/list]\nThe first 2 modes can also be played in co-op, but are not designed to.\nThere are more than 300+ episodes in [b]Solo[/b] alone, in addition to other modes, community workshop, and unlockable secret challenges.\nOverall, gameplay is addictive and easy to get, but certain \"tricks\" can be hard to master and certain levels are rage inducing (just like in the old times).\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe original had only sound effects for enemies, ninja and menu. This time around we've got a range of tracks to spice things up: there's ambient, there's dub, there's minimal techno and whatnot. 50+ tracks is enought to fill the vacuum without getting old.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nGraphics are clear, minimalistic with minimal fluff to clutter the screen.\nBut apart from that, the game has color customization, which is both good and bad thing. Some palettes are good, some are headache inducing and hard to read.

For those interested in the games history the exact details and older versions themselves can be found on their website.\n\nI started playing 'N 1.4' in early 2008 and became addicted, after a thousand or so hours on that title I moved on to the newer version, 'N 2.0'.\n\nI've been playing the game on and off over the years, sometimes going 6 months+ without playing yet the game has always been on my computer for the last decade and bit by bit I've accumulated a fair amount of time. So, after so much time spent playing such a great game I was a little apprehensive about this new version. Would it live up to the legacy of the older ones I fell in love with?\n\nIn a word: Yes!\n\nImo it strikes a great balance between staying true to the original game and giving us something new and justifying a new game. Not only does it deliver some great new content but the game now being fullscreen and released for modern computers makes it run amazingly smooth. The increased functionality in N++ gives the game something I wasn't even aware it needed.\n\nIn conclusion, if you love older versions of N or are someone looking to try something new, give N++ a go. The gameplay itself and almost unlimted replayability of the game more than justifies the money, when you throw in the amazing soundtrack, additional user generated content and overall ambiance and asthetics the game delivers then it's really a no brainer. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1532670661, "timestamp_updated": 1532670661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "43763007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070046707", "num_games_owned": 754, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 362, "last_played": 1558888109}, "language": "english", "review": "N++ is absolutely not for everyone, it's a deceptively simple looking platforming game, that can be brutally difficult.

As someone who used to (notice past tense) mostly play story heavy or open-world RPGs or strategy games, I was very surprised with how much I liked N++.  Lately, I've had less time to delve deeply into a story-rich game, and games like this that I can pick up/put down whenever are my go to.\n\nIf you love platformers, puzzlers, or even racing games (there is a timing element to each level), you will very likely LOVE N++!  No matter your skill level, you WILL get better if you persist.  And, unless you get obsessed (easy to do...\"just one more try...!), it's always fun.  It's great for developing mental focus and spatial problem-solving perseverance, as many of the later levels are so deviously designed that the slightest difference in speed, motion, or timing can make all the difference between making it through or being blown to bits...over...and over...and over again.  I have attempted some levels hundreds of time and have yet to beat them.  Yeah, I'm not the best, but I do it for fun and to blow off steam.\n\nThe retro aesthetics of the game, including the awesome electro/trance soundtrack, make the experience that much more addicting:  many fun color schemes to choose from.  I would describe it as a very \"zen\" gaming experience.  If you let yourself tense up (and you will!), your performance will suffer.  Breathe and focus.  Calmly analyze each scenario where you went wrong.  N++ rewards cool and collected problem solving...but you still have to apply it on a dime!  Some of the levels are downright sadistic, with little to no room for any errors.  I've heard some people describe this game as \"the 'Dark Souls' of platformers.\"  There is some merit to that.  I just reached over 5000 deaths today (yes, they have achievements for how many times you die...that's how much you WILL die in this game lol).\n\nBottom line:  highly enjoyable retro-styled platformer with deviously clever and difficult levels.  Low system reqs for those without uber gaming rigs.  N++ will fire your brain up, raise your heart rate, and make you sweat!  Warning:  if acute motor skills are difficult or frustrating for you, you might find yourself very frustrated with this game, as it requires a verrrry twitchy/delicate sense of control.

For that alone I would have passed some money the developer's way, but N++ is definitely worth it by itself.  It's a tough, unforgiving platformer in the mould of Super Meat Boy (or vice versa, given how old N is).  It has a peculiar momentum-based approach to platformer (screw physics!).  Once you get the hang of it, you'll be performing incredible walljumps and near-flying around levels.  There's a huge amount of levels to play; 9 hours in and I've barely completed half of them.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it's the adjustment in approach from N.  In N and N++ you have gold which you can collect to extend your forever-reducing timer.  In N, you had to go out of your way to collect gold to give yourself enough time to complete episodes (sets of 5 levels).  The only question was on which level you were going to divert to make sure you had enough time for later levels.  In N++, you can complete every episode (that I've played so far -- including several in E, the toughest category) without worrying about the timer.  You collect lots of gold easily on your way round, and you never have to worry about the time.  The gold is just if you want to get a high-score.  I can understand that this is a new approach: always completable but you can go back for high scores, but it means an episode is just an independent set of 5 levels. I miss the tension that the timer added in N.\n\nStill, recommended if you like games that kill you brutally every 2.3 seconds, but after one button press you're up and running again.  This time, you can avoid that mine. This time, you can jump over the missile.  This time, you got killed by a machine gun. But next time, next time was the mine.

An improved version of the game for us PC scrubs.\n\nI was a huge original N fan. I've been playing N since before N+ for XBLA came out. I enjoyed making maps, jumping around, and having my hopes and dreams crused by 88-4 in N 1.4.\n\nN++ is a game I would unreservedly recommend for anyone who was a fan of the original N, or for someone who enjoys physics-based platformers and challenge. It stays very true to the original N while adding some new mechanics that give a fresh new twist to the game (current favorite mechanic: toggle mines).\n\nIts performance is a huge improvement over the original N in ways that actually matter. Corner jumps can be done very reliably now for those with the skill to do them, and laser drones in pits will fire at you the exact moment you come into sight.\n\nHave I mentioned that I really like the levels? The intro section is a fantastic overview of the basics, which means the main game is free to get right into the meat of the gameplay without too much faffing about. All the levels in the N++ section are new, where the legacy episodes are derived from old levels that have been cleaned up and tweaked for N++.\n\nI do have a few minor gripes, however. Make no mistake, though, these are minor.\n\n* Sometimes, N++ feels a little TOO faithful to the original N. Death by falling from too high on a bounceblock is still a thing, as is the strange frictional interaction on the top surfaces of horizontally-moving thwumps. I can only assume these are still here for historical reasons, since it otherwise makes no sense (though I have hunches as to why they are the way they are within the code).\n* I know that collecting all the gold is an optional objective, but some levels make collecting all the gold a time consuming but not altogether challenging process, with individual flecks widely spaced out but numerous.\n* The death replay in the main menu includes suicides, which ends up showing a lot of replays where I suicided due to not being happy with my time or getting one piece of gold that I would still have an opportunity to get later. Preferably, the death replays would only show suicides when the topology of the map changed such that the exit became permanently inaccessible, but that gets a touch complicated.\n* N++'s tiles don't seem to include several \"micro\" tiles that I believe were present in N+ XBLA. I would have loved to see those make a comeback and for there to be more of them.\n* I haven't found a built-in way to import old N levels into N++. That would have been nice.\n* There are some audio and UI bugs, but I'll leave those out of this review. I have some faith they'll get patched eventually.\n\nEDIT: I made a comment about off-putting keybindings in this review. Since that has been changed, my complaint has been removed.

Some amazing games are 10-hour experiences, 20 if you replay and look for everything. This is the game built to last a lifetime. It does this by a number of vectors: \n\n1) a ridiculously high skill celing with open ended parkour-style gameplay which means that already open-ended levels offer an almost infinite continuum of routes, shortcuts and stunts you can pull off (despite being a three button game). Good games show off how creative the level and game designers are; timeless games let the player show off their own creativity in gameplay.\n\n2) A TON of levels, thousands of them, multiple goals and playstyles (all gold, highscore, speedrunning, local multiplayer, lots of secret missions and unlockables) and that all important level editor with online sharing and leaderboards. This, combined with an extremely rich and finetuned movement and gameplay design means the game literally never ends. You can always get better, you can always play new levels, and you can always make new levels.\n\n3) The online leaderboards which I mentioned before mean you can always get better at any level, and doing so gives you tangible rewards - replays that you can watch and of course that sweet, sweet highscore on the leaderboard. This drives the community to push the envelope with regards to creative routing through the level and to find ever more ways to speed the ninja up.\n\n4) The aforementioned finely-tuned gameplay. There are lots of platform games around, but none of them have the unique feel of N, and by extension, N++. Use your momentum to fling yourself around the screen, over huge chasms, around loops, up mountains and down into deadly caverns. Walljumping off of slopes, curves and (of course) walls, plus the interactions with level geometry and objects creates an endless variety of tricks to invent, discover and master.\n\nImagine the visceral thrill and speed of Sonic, the constant forward-planning and puzzle platforming of Lode Runner, and the challenge of Meat Boy only much more scalable due to you being able to set your own goals in the game. No other game can make me wince, scream, uncontrollably jump out of my seat or curse the level designer and call them horrible things like N++. No other game has a movement physics so precise that you can almost feel your character touching the walls and grazing past deadly mines.\n\nWith no scrolling, no fancy graphics or decorations, no storyline and no real mystery, each level gives you a god's-eye view of every trap, every enemy and every platform. Planning forwards becomes essential to weave in and out of enemies, what seems impossible eventually becomes second nature. You will level up as a player, not a character; and you will learn to cope with extreme stress and continue to press on against an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness.\n\nFinally, the presentation is a perfect melding of form and function, inspired by minimalist art, op art, technical diagrams, floor plans of buildings and architecture in general, the vector graphics and contemporary colour schemes are complimented by the smoothest framerate and literally perfect controls. Polish drips off of the game like one of those glossy magazines.\n\nOne of the timeless games, and the best skill-based platformer ever devised, taking the art of platforming down to the level of a sport and, dare I say it, a passion.\n\nSendy", "timestamp_created": 1475000797, "timestamp_updated": 1475000818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75864255428314209", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "25720089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052387228", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1476599740}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just like N from the glory days of flash games, but bigger and better.\nLike, \"level creator possibilities\" bigger and better.\nNow go ninja.

Tons of fun, tons of content, tons of homicidal robots, no lives, up to four ninjas. It can be frustrating at times, but you'll never feel like you died in an unfair way. \n\nThe gameplay is mostly focused on an extremely polished jumping system that takes into account momentum, speed and angles, making the game pretty hard to handle for the first time, even harder to master, but really satisfying once you are able to pull out your parkour skills. Your goal ? Unlock the exit and get out of here with as much gold as possible.\n\nThe game have also two multiplayer modes : the first one is a competitive race mode while the other one is a cooperation mode. The game also gives you a level editor to  make and share your levels all around the world. You can also play other people's levels, on PC as well as on PS4.\n\nThere's a couple of bad points though : first, no online mode. If you want to play multiplayer it'll be on the same PC, likely with up to four people sharing the same keyboard. It's okay when you're just two but when you're four it can become a bit messy. Another issue is that the game can become a bit repetitive : most of what you'll do is jumping around after all.\n\nAnyway, N++ is definitely a game I would advise you to buy, especially if you're a fan of hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy.

If you think Celeste is \"precise\", Super Meat Boy is \"hard\", Super Mario is \"expressive\", you're not wrong \u2014 but, still, N++ distills all of these qualities in the purest, most refined experience of jumping and moving in a 2D space.  \n\nUnbound by any concern whatsoever with things like narrative, worldbuilding, or thematic cohesion, N++ is just lines. Each of its *checks wikipedia* four thousand three hundred and forty stages (!!) is made up of a few perfectly straight lines, a mere dozen or so types of enemies and traps, and a number of square \"coins\" you may pick up as you traverse the level if you have the gall to go for any score higher than \"I was able to clear this level somehow\". \n\nThe only two things that prop up this ridiculous game are pure, unadulterated level design intelligence, and a physics engine that would make Einstein himself soil his trousers. Every single input you give to this game works double or triple duty. You know how in Super Smash Bros you can control the height of your jump depending on how long you press the button, and you can also do a \"short hop\" by lightly tapping it with a level of subtlety that's frankly unbecoming of the fighting genre?

Someone was smart enough to install it on the school server in the computer labs, and our teacher didn't care what we did as long as we did our assignments. It's probably one of the best flash games I've ever played. It's worth playing today. Great game\n\nI never played the Xbox sequel as I've never owned a Microsoft console, but everyone seems to love it.\n\nN++ is an awesome physics driven platformer with an insane amount of levels. The levels are divided into five level clusters to make things digestible. Very easy to hop in and out of this game.\n\nYou are a \"ninja\" who seeks gold. You have a limited amount of time to beat each cluster of levels. Collecting gold adds time to your time limit. The goal is to complete each level cluster with the most amount of time possible. It's possible to complete most clusters by ignoring gold and making a b-line to the end, however collecting gold takes you on a dangerous course that increases your score. The risk reward factor is real. \n\nThe small \"sprites?\" \"vector graphics?\" scale incredibly on a 4k display. The art style is simple but sharp. The animations are silky smooth. Dying sends your character into a dramatic funny ragdoll, that often bounces off of enemies, and blows up into physic driven pieces from bombs. \n\nThe gameplay is just great. This is a PURE single screen platformer.  All you do is run, jump, wall jump, and dodge. Every move and ricochet increases your speed which helps or hampers your efforts. You analyze the screen and dive right in. There's a great variety of enemies and traps to keep you on your toes. The level design is fantastic and plentiful. Even though the jump physics are a bit floaty, the screen real estate is HUGE and the direct control of your character is sharp. It feels great.\n\nThe coop modes and online score tracker just add to the experience.  \n\nThis is the best PURE platforming experience ever! You don't need power ups. I've never felt like such a savage just jumping and dodging before. The pick up and play aspect keeps this game in my rotation constantly. Just watch a few videos and you'll know if this one is for you. You can always try the original flash game, as it's basically the same game, different levels.\n\nThese games are just GREAT!   \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1611169765, "timestamp_updated": 1611169765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "83931787", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989742076", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 188, "playtime_forever": 3736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1694932388}, "language": "english", "review": "A limitless platformer with endless content and a whole lotta depth.

The game's mechanics are simple and overall make for a good fun experience.\nLet me get to the point here:\nMost people who don't play too much (maybe 50-100 hours) will say the N++ tab A-C row is fine, but after that it's too much. Of course, I have spent enough time to say Ultimate edition D row onwards (D-E and \"extra content\"/spoilers) is where it gets too hard, and the difficulty curve is insanely steep at that point. I beat Ult E today, and the last level took me an hour and a half, and that's not the longest I've spent on a level before. Here's the worst part: it gets even worse. I have seen the best players throw in over 5000 attempts at a few levels for (spoiler) reasons. Notably: Eeny-Meeny-Mine-y Moan, Compendium For Literates, Blood Monkey, The Catch, and a few others. The game definitely holds up to it's marketing, by far too much. The game gets much too difficult for anyone's good, and it's best to play casually unless you want to spend 1000s of hours improving and getting frustrated. 100% has been achieved by less than 20 people and the game has a high skilled community, with people playing the same mechanics and improving for 15 years since the original N.\n\nNow that I have that over with, here's my review on the rest of the game: Highscoring in general is super fun and movement flows perfectly. I love mapping, and it's really fun to find new ways to set up specific tiles/entities and see what you can do, each map (hopefully) being unique and very versatile while still being extremely approachable. Most importantly, the community for the game is the best part, we hang out in the discord (join us too at http://discord.gg/nplusplus) and chat about highscores, community projects (like a tab), mapping, and completion, and sometimes vent in channels and ask for support (literally in game, and figuratively while playing lol). I recently have begun to speedrun this game, and that is super fun especially on earlier rows, my personal favorite is B row.\n\nOverall great game, smooth gameplay and tons of content, levels, and opportunity, but much too hard, I would suggest playing casually and not really thinking about 100%. I am not saying don't do completion, just it gets hard to the point of pixel perfect or frame perfect jumps and that's not fun.", "timestamp_created": 1574824590, "timestamp_updated": 1606705793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "81142608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048564154", "num_games_owned": 1240, "num_reviews": 230, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1606693450}, "language": "english", "review": "60 fps lock", "timestamp_created": 1606693613, "timestamp_updated": 1606693613, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.314659297466278076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "81083792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835019296", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1637, "last_played": 1671048879}, "language": "english", "review": "Mario if Mario was made and released by a bunch of villans who enjoy your suffering, by seeing your character die in the exact same way, approximately 47 times each and every minute.\n\nsomehow, EXTREMELY recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1606666645, "timestamp_updated": 1606666645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "80922258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200666330", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1714354819}, "language": "english", "review": "This platformer is both fun hardish and unfrustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1606591218, "timestamp_updated": 1606591218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "80913065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210532404", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 95503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95116, "last_played": 1675830184}, "language": "english", "review": "The best single player no frills platformer.

The game play is fun but 15 bucks is a little pricey. I do like that only one person has to buy it and multiple people can play along! Keep in mind that steam remote play can get laggy and blurry at times. So honestly if you don't plan on sitting down and working to beat the levels, don't get it.

One of the best co-op and single player games I've ever played. \n\nN++ is tough, real tough; but also easy, real easy. The range of emotions you'll feel while playing this game ranges from downright painful to a euphoric high from finally completing a level you've been stuck on for hours. Some levels are easy levels that give you a break - some easy wins to get you feeling good. Other levels are painfully hard and test you and your friend's patience with both the game and each other. I've played this game in single player, and in multiplayer with different amounts of people and different combinations of skill levels. \n\nIt's amazing how many different experiences you can have with this game by simply changing the amount of people you're playing with. A co-op level that was simple with 3-4 people is now a brain teasing puzzle with 2. Single player levels can be a fun romp with 2 people, but can be ball bustingly hard by yourself. The game is highly customizable in a sense depending on how many friends with a high difficulty tolerance you've got. \n\nI'm honestly not sure how to describe the level design because it changes based on how you're approaching the levels. If you want to collect all the coins in a level it's going to often times be much harder than if you just run through the level disregarding the coins. Levels can range from a well crafted challenge to an easy speedrun based on your priorities alone. There are also [spoiler]secret challenges you can unlock that make you do specific tasks in each level[/spoiler], although I haven't unlocked any of them yet and didn't know about them until I looked up how to unlock some extra stuff online. The game has over 4000 levels, so there's a few that feel like stinkers in there, but the majority of the 4000+ levels are fun - which is incredibly impressive. \n\nI highly recommend N++ if you like challenging platformers. I've played it for over 20 hours and I still haven't gotten through a third of the levels. It's fun with friends and fun alone.

You control the ninja only with 3 keys - left, right and jump. Movement still requires skill because it is momentum based, so the ninja takes lots of time to accelerate. The control of this momentum becomes a second nature after a while and it feels good to make some tricky manuver and retain your speed. Unfortunately there are also enemies. You will have to dodge those rockets and jump between fast moving enemy-dots. This theoretically makes it so that planning and subconscious anticipation of enemy moves is essential and your fast reflexes won't save you. Unfortunately in practice you still need to have quick reflexes and timing, but you have to make you split second decision a second before the danger really happens. For instance there was this flustrating level where you have to jump between fast moving dots. You cannot start your run and jump just before there is an opening, you have to start it some time earlier. It felt like quick reacting to non-existant signal.\n\nI also don't really like the level design. In many platformers when you are going with the intended speed then to some extent timing of environment and enemies synchronizes to give you satisfying feeling and to tell you that you are doing it right. It doesn't happen here. There are many roads you can take when solving level and due to enemies reacting to your presence situation quite quickly becomes random (there is no rng in this game, but your interaction with environment still may led to dangerous unforeseen situations). Someone may even enjoy the self dependence required to tackle such situations, but I would rather have more manufactured experience where everything that happens was planned by developers. Each level has achievement for collecting all gold (which lets you unlock even more levels). Oftentimes there is a lot of gold scattered around the level and collecting it all requires a long, complicated and messy route and constant dealing with quickly changing enemy situation.\n\nNot all issues appear in all levels. You have to finish 5 levels to unlock them. In those 5 levels some will be easy, some will be quite enjoyable, but there may appear some really flustrating one. If you decide to quit you will have to start unlocking this set of 5 episodes from the beginning next time. This is especially flustrating if in your opinion this level should be removed from the game.

Literally every millisecond matters in this game. oh you pressed the jump key too long? too bad you just died. you jumped too soft? dead. You have to be precise.

I didn't include the 1625 levels of hardcore because it's the same levels as solo but only this time you need to be faster. Much faster.\n\nThere was ''only'' 500 levels in the first N game that came out in 2005. So this is a huge improvement. There's more variety in this too. Many different enemies. Different game modes. Better graphics. Fullscreen. And AMAZING soundtracks.\n\nIt deserves to be bought at full price. It's not expensive, there's no dlcs, no micro-transactions, no early access and all that bs like everywhere else. Simply a great game. In my opinion the best platformer game ever made.\n\nEdit: After completing the first block of 500 N++ levels, I saw another 100 levels appear! the X row. That means other blocks of levels have the same additional hidden 100 levels that appear once you complete the block. Which means theres definitely 4000+ levels in total.\n\nLovely isn't it\n\nEdit 2: I see now in the description it says already that there are 4340 levels in total :P Anyway I hope this review was helpful to you, thanks for reading and have fun", "timestamp_created": 1544198302, "timestamp_updated": 1577452984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695405781269073486", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "60425480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041699470", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 1613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 554, "last_played": 1577907773}, "language": "english", "review": "level editor seems to be messed up or something. it says F is a control button to alter placed object, when I press it just closes out the whole game.

Loads and loads of dying.\n\n[h3]STORY, I GUESS?[/h3]\n\nThere's an excuse of a story.  You're a ninja, seeking enlightenment through 5-room challenges known as 'Episodes'.  Your superhuman metabolism can only be sustained with the delight of gold, and if time runs out, you die.  [b]That's it.[/b]\n\n[h3]GAMEPLAY[/h3]\n\nIndeed, N++ is all about the gameplay.  Your goal's to first hit an exit switch, then make for the door, while not getting killed or running out of time.  This simple goal is made fiendishly difficult for three reasons.  First, you cannot take any damage, otherwise you die, with your ragdoll typically getting abused in ways that loop from horrifying to hilarious.  Half the fun sometimes is just watching how your dead body gets abused this time.\n\nSecond problem?  Everything that isn't terrain, a switch, a door, or you, wants to kill you.  Gauss gun drones, mines, copies of yourself that follow after you, drones that orbit paths, drones that zero in on you, mines, falling too fast, ascending too fast, the timer, mines, and laser drones all want you as dead as possible, and all will kill you if you miscalculate even once.\n\nThird issue?  You're on a 90-second time limit, and every bit of gold adds a paltry 2 seconds to that clock.  What's more, gold is often placed in precarious positions, and you'll often need to extend the timer out to make it through an episode, forcing you to put yourself at greater risk.\n\nThis is a very simple game on the surface, with clearly defined mechanics, and it also manages to be insanely, excruciatingly hard, without being outright unfair.  This isn't quite a rage game, though it does come damn close to being one.  Everything is quickly communicated, restarting is easy, you have unlimited lives, and the game keeps it's levels confined to one screen's worth of space.  The difficulty comes in navigating these short levels without getting zapped, shot, exploded, crushed, or slamming into the floors too hard, all while keeping within the time limit.  It's extremely easy to get into N++, and extremely difficult to master it.\n\nThere's multiplayer, too!  Co-op or competitive, as well as a level editor and sharing included, letting you play whatever fiendish deathtraps the community has cooked up and will cook up until the heat death of the universe.  Haven't played it, but I know it exists, and that the community has likely encouraged others to 'git N-lightened'.\n\n[h3]GRAPHICS[/h3]\n\nGraphics are like the story; minimalist, to this game's benefit and to my delight.  N's style was always sort of minimalist - The biggest effects typically relegated to your demise, after all - And all the better for it, and N++ keeps this minimalism and cranks it up a notch or two, with your ninja barely any better than a stick figure here, but still conveying their current state of being perfectly.  Enemies are little better - Anything aside from communicating to you exactly what they are and how they plan on killing you has been excised.  All of this sounds like it shouldn't work, and yet everything remains utterly readable.  It helps that everything is typically confined to a single screen's worth of real estate.  No losing yourself, nothing that isn't contributing to gameplay in some way, shape, or form.  Pure minimalistic perfectioN.\n\n[h3]REPLAY VALUE + IS IT WORTH IT?[/h3]\n\nReplayability is a major factor of N++ - Improving your times, going for no-death runs, trying new levels, or simply going through your favorites is quite easy, and the game's clearly built to be enjoyed for quite some time.\n\nIs N++ worth the money?  That depends.  This game is definitely not for everyone, mind you.  It can be FRUSTRATING.  It's difficult.  It's never unfair, it's never impossible, and everything is clearly communicated to you, but N++ can be a maddeningly difficult game due to level design and enemy placement being very tight indeed.\n\nIf you're into that sort of thing, N++ is worth the dough.  If you're the type to frustrate easily, best look elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1708577616, "timestamp_updated": 1715206878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644970417022705078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "164851775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082331456", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1716820876}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing like I've known it for the first time 14 years ago on PSP.", "timestamp_created": 1715102646, "timestamp_updated": 1715102646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "164093590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044711233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1736402412}, "language": "english", "review": "The best platformer ever made.

Guide your character, the ninja, avoiding various traps, obstactles, and fall damage in search of riches. (gold coins scattered throughout levels).  The ninja can wall jump and move in any direction.  Every level has at least one door switch that opens a door to the end of the level.  Navigate to that open door to finish a level.  There are between 2000 and 2500 total official levels in three modes called Co-op, race, and solo mode ranging from easy/tutorial scaling up to the extremely challenging.  All of these modes consist of episodes that have a pack of 5 levels together.  As time passes in a level the score counts down.  When that score hits 0 the ninja explodes and must start the level over.  The time is additive in every episode.  Collecting gold adds time.  After beating an episode, it is possible to select levels individually.  There are global leaderboards for every individual level and episode as well as friend leaderboards and replays for every best personal score.  There is an in-game editor where players can make and play community made levels.    \n\nPros:\n-Fantastic control of character.  Seemingly limitless possibilities with different routes and strategies.\n-Enough game content to play for well over 100 hours.\n-Game content is all extremely high quality.  This game just keeps giving unexpectedly, even more than advertised.  The developers were perfectionists with this game arguably to a fault from a game developer's perspective.  A fantastic opportunity for the consumer.  It is obviously a game made out of love over a long period of time.\n-Devs plan to add even more content (more levels and game modes) and always intently listen to their player base. \n-Soundtrack is 3+ hours of high quality music.\n-Players have full access to a level editor where we can make and play user levels that also have leaderboards.\n-Game scales in difficulty appropriately so that it is newbie friendly and then turns into an expert challenge.\n\nCons:\n-No online multiplayer.  Only local multiplayer.\n-Currently the player can die and restart any level on episode mode without penalty so that the episode leaderboards are like playing any individual level anyway, yet they do not record on the individual level leaderboard while playing in episode mode.  This makes the individual level concept/leaderboard quite redundent.\n-On episode mode it is possible for a level to be impossible if the time is low enough entering the next level.  If this happens the player is forced to start the episode over and the game gives no warning when this happens.\n-The story of the game is fairly bland.\n-In the editor players can make impossible levels.\n\nOpinion:\n      N++ is a masterpiece, brilliant platformer.  The price of the game is dirt cheap for all the content in it.  If you are at all interested in platformers this is a must buy.  The game is focused on the platforming gameplay, not on the story so that doesn't matter much.  It is an absurd amount of content as it is yet more is planned to be added.  The flaws with individual level and episodes are minuscule and you have to go out of your way to discover these minor nitpicks.  They could not afford online Co-op.  If the game sells enough they will implement it.  The impossible levels in the editor are a definite nuisance but fortunately there are ways to sort levels by best or featured so this isn't obtrusive. \n\nBottom line:\n      N++ is brilliant and every bit as good as advertised.  If you don't enjoy this game it is because you don't like the platforming genre.

The spartan, vector-based aesthetic exemplifies and serves the minimalist design well, always putting concise, clear communication above extravagance without coming at the cost of sleek style. \n\nN++'s physics-based controls (which are at times more like piloting a graceful glider than running and jumping) may not come as intuitively as a Super Mario or Rayman Legends, but once you grow accustomed to them, you'll likely find they reward practice and patience more than any competitor.\n\nAnd that's NumberWang.", "timestamp_created": 1472156080, "timestamp_updated": 1655394168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621726274490356445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "116791852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355928246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3880, "last_played": 1719691436}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty Good", "timestamp_created": 1654907036, "timestamp_updated": 1654907036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "116594452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052225708", "num_games_owned": 800, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 4406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1678054283}, "language": "english", "review": "the nostalgia", "timestamp_created": 1654552531, "timestamp_updated": 1654552531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591078042984008789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "116566058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155876076", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3309, "last_played": 1712465789}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun", "timestamp_created": 1654505672, "timestamp_updated": 1654505672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "116442640", "author": {"steamid": "76561199055949136", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 9000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1199, "last_played": 1739486434}, "language": "english", "review": "wow so ninja!", "timestamp_created": 1654292080, "timestamp_updated": 1654292080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "116410541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014484414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 624, "last_played": 1698175147}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1654237007, "timestamp_updated": 1654237007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "116340867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198951835179", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 514, "last_played": 1733608903}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

It may have non of Mario's charm, but I think it makes up for it in its criminally great soundtrack, massive library of levels, and much faster browsing of stages made by people online.

As of the time I'm writing this, I'm a few steps away from earning 100% in N++. Heck, I'm tackling the hardest challenge in the game right now, which seasoned players will know simply as \"eeny.\" The grind has been an emotional experience, so I figured now would be a great time to revisit my thoughts.\n\nLet me start with the traditional blanket statement: N++ is the best platformer I have played, and will ever play. Though I have many reasons, most of them can be boiled down to \"damn this game is so hard, but damn this game feels so good.\"\n\nThe game embodies \"intrinsic motivation\" through its momentum-based mechanics and superb design. The three-button control scheme lures you down the rabbit hole, narrow in scope but deeper than you could ever fully fathom. The multi-layered design accompanies the gameplay well, creating one of the smoothest skill curves I've ridden, if sheerly because of the game's breadth of content. Stuck on something? Not to worry, there are thousands of other levels you can try.\n\nTo delve into spoilers for a moment: [spoiler]challenges are such a cool way to add more flavour and difficulty to the content in the game. A level could go from being complete filler to busting your balls for several hours straight, or your gradual skill improvement could tame a level that previously gave you a hard time. The process of discovering these challenges and working your way through their cruel and creative solutions extends the game's lifespan far past what most 2D platformers attempt to achieve.[/spoiler]\n\nWell, let's say that completion doesn't appeal to you. Not to worry, maybe another activity will tickle your fancy. You've got plenty to pick from: co-op, highscoring, speedrunning, competitive racing, deathless runs, playing userlevels, level editing \u2014 hell, you can even make your own colour palettes and sound effects.\n\nThis leads me to another exceptional asset this game benefits from: its community. It may seem odd to comment on the community of a game without online play, but the more you strive toward improving your skill at this game, the more likely you are to meet members of the devoted and talented band of ninjas who spearhead the modern image of N++. This community goes beyond supporting other players; during the year I've spent with them, I've witnessed an inspiring culture of empathy, vulnerability, and terrible memes about the ninja having a thick ass. In a game so relentlessly difficult, it's stunning to look back on how much it has humanized me through all the friends I met. I would have given up several hundred hours earlier without them. \n\nIf a game like Celeste embodies what it's like to scale a mountain, N++ embodies what it's like to break a mountain with your bare hands. It'll take a long, long time. It'll take loads of effort with seemingly no hope of success at times. Every layer you shatter reveals another, sturdier layer underneath. But you will always have the power to tear that mountain down. You'll feel yourself become stronger and, no matter how long the mountain endures, you'll claw back with the motivation to turn that rock into a damn toothpick.", "timestamp_created": 1667470187, "timestamp_updated": 1674466091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848345518112182617", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "131147566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009641717", "num_games_owned": 534, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1674754622}, "language": "english", "review": "A good and fast-paced platformer that requires high levels of precision and skill to get through, with a wide variety of levels.

The momentum-based movement is taken into full consideration with the level design; most levels (of which there are thousands) have unique layouts that are hand-crafted to be difficult, but readily understandable; coins are enticing due to their direct usefulness and not solely for collecting's sake; the music sets the mood without distracting from gameplay, and the clear-cut graphical style makes it easy to analyze each level and formulate a plan. If you want a platformer in pure form, definitely give this a go.\n\nTHAT SAID, there are certainly issues I have with this game. The further you delve into the extensive grid of levels, the more you will start to find outliers. While the vast majority of levels feel original and justified, there are a smattering of levels with cookie-cutter design, long-haul repetitiveness, and coins that feels less like a worthy challenge and more like a laughably absurd spike of time and effort. If you don't get that impression, then, thankfully, you're less cynical than me.\n\nCompleting this game 100% is quite a task. I would dare to call it a wholly ridiculous task, due to some of the coin collecting. Many coins feel like they were placed as a callous slap to the face of the player, set in areas that demand inhuman levels of precision - and the nerves to perform these feats of skill many minutes into a level, risking a painful amount of failure with the slightest mistake. And sometimes there's just a monumental grid of coins that looks like it would take all day to grab. Combine that with an already perilous level structure, and you've got yourself a slog of a level.\n\nAm I complaining that it's too hard? Yeah, a bit. And it's fair if you ignore this review because of that. But whether or not a relatively easy level with half a million coins spilled across the board is fair, I just can't find any fun in it.\n\nPlay this game casually if you're seeking a rough, tough platforming experience that'll keep you busy for hours, but I sincerely advise you to avoid completing this game 100% if you don't  know exactly what you're in for.

Homie is completely ripped, 8 feet tall, dudes practically a nordic viking. On top of all that, hes also hot as hell. Now suppose god throws you a stick and is like \"ok now kill that guy with this stick\". That is practically my N++ experience.\n\nNow you might be wondering, how in the hell would you kill this guy with just a stick? I mean, dude generates enough force to blow Jupiter out of existence just by flexing his pectorals. And yes, I agree with this statement, but you've gotta understand dear reader, that if you poke that large lad with the stick for a long enough period of time, at some point it will begin to hurt. By no means are you gonna get it done instantly, but as long as you persist and have a good mentality, you will eventually pierce his flesh.\n\nI'm writing this review as I finish solo mode, which is essentially me cutting off all 4 limbs and the torso off this guy. Still have coop and race left, but solo the bulk of the experience. New players begin the game and typically get overwhelmed by the seemingly infinite amount of content, and likely drop the game after finishing intro and maybe a row or two. They think that no matter what, they can never finish this beastly game. Trust me I know the feeling, because starting out I had the same thoughts. Regardless, if you just play little by little, poke the beast to death bit by bit, you will notice steady, good progress, and suddenly the game will not feel as massive anymore. I've really found that the majority of this game is a mental challenge. If you go into each day with the mentality that you WILL beat a few levels, then within a few months you will notice that you too have chopped off maybe a limb or two. But enough about this weird ass analogy, lets talk about the game.\n\nI'd like to think I'm a seasoned platformer player, and coming out of this incredible campaign I can say with confidence that this the most raw platforming experience ive ever had. The learning curve is surprisingly massive; just when you think you are getting good, the game will throw some new precision mechanic at you to master, and man am I all for it. It really does feel like metanet tried everything when designing the levels, and so you will have the opportunity to do literally EVERYTHING in this game. The controls and physics may feel awkward at first, but at some point it begins to feel incredibly natural, like you are one with da ninja. The experience has been completely positive for me, of course with the exception of a few nasty levels. However, this pool of levels is small compared to the amount of great stuff, so don't let it deter you!\n\nNeedless to say, this game has been great, and I have been pretty sad that the campaign is over. Doesn't even feel like its been that long since ive started. And thats why I urge you all to give this game a shot; to experience that feeling of wonder that comes from playing this games campaign for the first time. The road may seem unending, and the ripped guy may seem to never fall, but slowly and surely things will swing in your favor, and I promise you that.\n", "timestamp_created": 1666209929, "timestamp_updated": 1666209929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713624358177185059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "124081348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008738481", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1666201980}, "language": "english", "review": "i hate platforming\nbut this game really tops it with its floaty, slow movement, lack of any extra abilities other than jumping, annoying challenges and enemies, all of that topped off with a constantly ticking timer", "timestamp_created": 1666203336, "timestamp_updated": 1666203912, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.357811599969863892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "25154304", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997431235", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1700748127}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing soundtrack, no load times and fast-paced twitch action.\n\nWhen everything goes right in a level you will feel like a ninja.

The only thing it is missing is Online Multiplayer.\n\nIn a little more depth, if you've never played a game in the series:\n\nIn my opinion, the greatest aspect of this game is the challenge. In essense, it isn't too challenging once you get the basics down. You move around expertly designed levels, momentum is key, and certain things kill you. You have 90 seconds to complete an episode of 5 levels, and the gold coins scattered around the levels give you 2 extra seconds each.\n\nThe majority of the episodes are not too challenging to complete in 90 seconds; What makes it difficult are the tight controls; You clip corners quite often here; One wrong move, and you're dead, falling, losing momentum, etc... Combine that, and a subtle play on your desire to be better; faster; and you have one of the greatest platforming games of all time. As is the standard for this series,; There is also a level creator and sharing capabilities.\n\nI've waited since the Original for there to be a Sequel on PC (Mostly, one with controller support) and now that it is here, i'm far from dissapointed. Sure, the lack of Online, Real time Multiplayer (Survivals, Races, Co-Op) is a little saddening, but i do personally enjoy the Solo aspect far too much to not buy this game, regardless.\n\nI would easily say this is one of the best games you can buy for under $15.", "timestamp_created": 1472173739, "timestamp_updated": 1472173739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520833313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "25153148", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980676884", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1645572812}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing N in one form or another since I was a kid, it seems only fair the devs get some of my money now. \n\nThis isn't at all a departure from the series, this is N Classic with more polish, new elements, new maps, a map editor, better music, and same-system co-op. \n\nSame controls, same atmosphere, and same butt-clenching stress as before. Sound good? Great.\n\nIf you're new to the series, the older games are available online still, check em out.\n\nDon't let anybody tell you this is like Super Meat Boy. The controls are similar, but Super Meat Boy manufactures difficulty by forcing you to move through the map at high speeds, and swinging obstacles into the field of view quickly - so you essentially have to memorize the map by dying a certain number of times. Or maybe your reaction time is way better than mine, who am I to judge (Synth)\n\nHere, you see the entire map at once, and once you have the hang of enemy movement patterns, you can plan your route before the timer even starts, and it's not uncommon to finish a map in one gloriously satisfying, white-knuckle first try, barely squeezing through gaps in mines and racing past homing missiles.\n\nIt's...

In the race mode after you take to long or press a button the game will enter the you suck stage. In that stage it will slowly make the level easier to get someone to win the race. That's all fine and dandy, but when I'm getting ticked of because a level is to hard don't go tell me I suck. That's a sure-fire way to annoy me to the point I ALT+F4.\n- When you win a race you can be a rocket to hinder your foes, but the rocket tends to fly into a wall before I even had the chance to steer.\n\nIt's a great game.

I love being able to create my own stuff, but that being said the editor UI feels very clunky and the level sharing in general is missing a lot of core features that really aught to exist (such as being able to save user levels for later, or delete your own published levels off the server).\n\nSome people will find that the game is overall too simple, and that's fine.

On the perspective by just looking at it, it's fun to play and the simple controls works great with keyboards. Your primary objective is to reach for the key card and find your way to the exit. If you want to, you may challenge yourself to collect all gold blocks in the level without dying. Its almost no different than any other platformers, but what makes it special is that it has very unique UI color schemes and awesome techno musics. The music helps you to concentrate while playing and you never feel bored. You kept dying again and again but in result you won't want to give up on playing anymore because you are so into the game by just listening the musics. The game also rewards you new color schemes after completing a certain number of stages and each of them is very pleasant looking. Clearly this game has a distinctive way to express its beauty.\n\nThe game is predicated on tough jumps and controls, and its very own physics system that's built on momentum. All you can really do with your ninja avatar is run and jump, but you must be able to use acceleration and precise leaps to land on your desired place. By trying to complete the level you will be experienceing countless deaths and resulting successes eventually makes you feel that you have really achieved a lot of things. The game tells you to complete each level within 90 seconds and picking up gold along the way to increase your timer. If you are to become a hardcore player (like me), you will likely want to collect all the gold up.\n\nN++ has a huge number of campaign levels (2000+) and even more levels uploaded by the players all around the world.

The Co-op levels requires 2-4 players to play, and there will be parts where you have to kill yourself into hazards to make a way for your friend to reach to the exit. But usually it's pretty much the same with solo levels (sometimes you can complete a Co-op level all by yourself). You can also play the uploaded levels as well, or you can make levels of your own and upload them like others. Unfortunately it's a huge dissapointment that there is no online play for the Co-op levels.\n\nN++ might lack online play and feel like more of the same, but it's pretty much everything a platformer fan could want out of a sequel.

These were, mostly, the only games that you could share or show to other people. And among your Fancy Pants Man and Run, there was N. One little ninja VS a seemingly impossible number of levels, fueled by gold and a passion for juking rockets.\n\nI played the eff out of it. And then, in time, I came to the edge of my abilities. The limits to my perseverence. Eventually, I stopped, but not before enjoying it half to death. There were a few other times, in later years, when I came back to it on a memory trip, downloaded it off the webpage, and kept a tally of deaths as I strived for 100% completion. But again, I eventually became overwhelmed by life and such.\n\nAnd now N++ is here. Faster. Simpler. Bigger and, I will say, better. And now, with tunes. It is the essential N experience, and I am so happy it exists. I can feel myself entering that platforming Zen as I work my way though, a rock garden full of mines and golden flowers.

similarly the sound effects i feel is easily overlooked as they're simple sounds which fit whatever enemy is approaching or whatever the ninja has just touched, and they add a sense of livliness to each level as something as simple as a rocket launcher firing sends an instant message to the player and it all blends together nicely to give a very aestically pleasing theme to the game.\n\nalso something i feel that is a huge positive in the game is that there is no luck or rng, everything is based purely off of cycles or is determined by the players actions meaning that the frustration factor for me felt much lower, as any mistake made i wasn't blaming something cheap or something i couldn't do anything about but rather i did something wrong and i should figure out what it was and why i made said mistake, in essence the design of N++ is made so that you feel a huge sense of overcoming a challenge of your own volition compared to just getting lucky.\n\nas of the time of writing this review, i have 100% completed the game in its entirety and i felt writing this review any sooner would be a huge injustice to the game as pretty much any clever idea you can think of for a level gimmick was explored in some way or another, and let me say it never got old, 150 hours in i felt i'd seen it all then 300 hours in, then 500 and it just never stopped until i was finally done with everything and i felt very satisfied that the developers knew exactly what  made something unique and stick out, and this especially applies to the secret tabs and their levels, they are expetional examples of how secret levels should be done with them being even more gimmicky and unusually designed than the normal sets of levels.\n\nhowever with any good game, there are always flaws and ill try to keep my criticisms to a minimum since i adore this game dearly, firstly hardcore generally is unenjoyable, having to beat 25 levels deathless is pretty yucky as is, but because difficulty is ordered by row and not column it meant the difficulty of these columns feels a bit sporadic and can be either easy or randomly hard simply due to the fact that difficulty isn't entirely ordered this way.\n\nneeding to complete co-op mode without an online multiplayer function ingame is a bit counterintuitive, since those on console are at a massive disadvantage if they have no-one who they can play local co-op with, although the developers have explained their reasoning behind why it isn't it and they really want to, for now i do have to mark it as a negative point ;-; but a positive linked to this is the community is so warmingly welcoming and helpful that people are willing to lend a helping hand, and i'd have never made it to 100% without them, truly i mean it when i say the N++ community is the best community i have ever been in.\n\nand possibly the greatest flaw the game has, is save file corruption, especially with a game of this size and caliber, and although ive never had to deal with it myself i can't imagine how it feels to lose hundreds or even thousands of hours of progress due to being unaware of the fact that save files are known to randomly corrupt, meaning any competionist is required to make frequent backups to avoid the risk of losing everything.\n\nwith all the negatives out of the way though, the game is an absolute masterpiece and is about as close to perfection as a platformer will ever get, and i would recommend it to absolutely anyone ever no matter your skill at games as i think N++ is a game that anyone can take something away from, but with it being a niche of platformers, and a niche within platformers themselves i could understand why someone may not feel the same way as i.\n", "timestamp_created": 1648948101, "timestamp_updated": 1648948101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.775222957134246826", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "113150128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019677899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8289, "last_played": 1701281003}, "language": "english", "review": "Best platformer game ever made, simple as that.

Don't let the minimalist style tell you otherwise.\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1][list]\n[*]Beautiful minimalist style, from the color pallets to the ninja and enemies.

Just assumed it faded into obscurity until Steam randomly pulled it up. I think it was due to a weekend sale or something but to Steam I says thank ya' kindly. Playing it has been really nostalgic, and just to make sure I get it right this time I've been finishing each episode 100% before I go to the next. It seems challenging at first but if you do them in order it feels incremental in a challenging enough way.\n\nAnother thing to note about the game if you buy it; make sure to watch replays. The game has some physics you're supposed to learn and the replays show you pros doing it. The can give you enormous speed boosts or jump power depending on what you want!\n\n\nHere's a link back to the Steam page!\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/230270/N_NPLUSPLUS/\nThank you for reading!

But yet....again, I keep playing.....why?!?  Why God?  Why must I be punished in such a sickly enjoyable way.\n\nRamblings aside, get this game.  Don't be a loser.  Stop standing on the sidelines hoping that you'll one day grow the balls to handle this ride, because it just ain't going to happen.  Pull out your wallet, get your $hit together, and shoot for the stars.  And if you don't reach them, at least you'll hit a strategically placed mine or rocket along the way.

Gold coins which extend your lifetime are placed throughout levels littered with hazards like mines, lasers, floating drones, and missile launchers. It's your job to reach the door switch and get to the door with enough time left to complete the episode without dying in the process.\n\nThe ninja runs and jumps in the same way he has before. If you've played an N game in the past, you know how to play. New movement techniques are made apparent to you over the course of the levels naturally through smart level design. You'll learn how to effectively fly across levels, perform seemingly impossible feats of dexterity, and dodge every manner of obstacle as a matter of necessity. An impressive difficulty curve makes every episode (a set of 5 levels) just challenging enough to be fun without being frustrating. Different combinations of hazards and wall placements drastically change the approaches that can be taken in a level.\n\nCompletionists like myself will enjoy the gold-tracking included on the level selection screen. Each level has gold coins placed intentionally to provide a further challenge; getting all of them in a level marks the level with a coin, and getting all of them in an episode marks the episode with a coin, so you can easily see which episodes you've gotten all coins in and which levels need to be coin-completed to complete their episodes. Sometimes, getting all of the coins in a level is easy, and happens almost automatically as you make your way through. Other times, getting them all will make a level significantly harder as you're forced to put yourself into greater danger. Achievements track your gold collection for rows of 20 episodes, and also for completing rows without dying, which is a tall order indeed. \n\nAs I mentioned, collecting these coins extends your lifetime (the game timer) by two seconds each. Your lifetime is saved between levels within episodes and serves as your score upon episode completion. In games past, some levels have used the timer to put time pressure on the player aside from the pressure to get a higher score. I've yet to see any such levels in this game (I'm on the 35th episode of the second episode portion - details below).\n\nAs is par for the series at this point, included in the game are tons and tons of levels. The introductory portion of the game has 25 episodes and so 125 levels. There are two more portions after that with 100 episodes each, and therefore 500 levels each. That brings the total number of episodes in the game to 225 and the total number of levels to 1125. Each one is a joy to play and is satisfying to complete, as far as I've gotten. The third portion of levels looks to be made of levels from earlier games, and is titled \"Legacy.\" The true icing on the cake is that a level editor and community support are also included in the game, and already a vast multitude of levels have been produced. A near-infinite variety in level design exists for those willing to bring it about.\n\nMusic for the game is a sort of ambient, electronic style that fits well with the overall aesthetic of the game. It's quite unintrusive. The color scheme of the entire game can be changed at will with LT (or L-shift) within any menu, including the pause menu in-level.  There are 24 schemes to choose from, each of which changes the color of everything in the game, including all surfaces, hazards, coins, and menu items, and is unlocked as you complete more episodes. The color of the ninja and his headband can also be changed independently, though the colors they can be changed to are contingent on the selected overall color scheme. There are 4 options for ninja and headband color per color scheme. Additionally, there are 7 headband behavior options (and also an option for no headband) that slightly alter the physical appearance of the headband, which has no effect on gameplay. Players will find that different color schemes offer different levels of hazard visibility, which is an important consideration. There are enough options to choose from that there's no complaint to be made in that area.\n\nMy final remarks on the game will be on difficulty. This is a high-difficulty platformer, as the games before it have been. So far, I've played only a few levels that I think would pose a true challenge to players who have played each level before it. Of course, trying to get all the coins complicates the matter, but doing so is a conscious choice. Already, some levels have been brutally difficult to collect all of the coins in. I have no doubt that the kid gloves will truly be taken off as I reach the final episodes the game has to offer. Only those willing to push themselves to high peaks of performance will excel here.\n\nIn summary, N++ is a terrific addition to the N family that has done nothing but improve the N experience. Gameplay has remained almost completely unchanged, with only additions to the types of hazards encountered and the actual levels you navigate. The game looks awesome and plays phenomally, which is an absolute must for a hardcore platformer. I highly recommend N++ to all platformer fans.", "timestamp_created": 1484356314, "timestamp_updated": 1484357136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519230782985687256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "29235442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065811995", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1502307110}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing platformer.

I guess I'll just play for as long as the return policy allows me... wait, how am I at five hours already?!\n\nFull - This game is a great example on how to do difficult platform games correctly. Minimalistic graphics and electronic music aside, this game excels in two key things: controls and level design. The controls are the more interesting of the two aspects. At first I found them to be both stiff and slippery at the same time, and I thought that gameplay would suffer massively because of it. Thankfully, I was proven wrong, as the controls are optimized for accurate air control, which you will be doing a lot of. This brings us nicely to the level design, which while difficult [naturally], accompanies the controls amazingly. Any deaths that occur are on you and any inaccuracies on your input, instead of insanely BS level design (even if it seems like that); the way it should be.\n\nThe game may be overtly difficult, but, lucky for you, you have unlimited lives. This allows you to run through the stages again and again to fine-tune your accuracy and speed, and maybe, just maybe, make it into the top 500 in the global scoreboards.

If not, read one, but first, Pros vs Cons\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\nSimple platforming controls\nSimple and clean graphics\nHuge number of levels (2300+)\nBuilt in level editor + built in userlevel browsing\nLeaderboards\nFantastic music\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nUI is slightly messy, difficult to navigate with mouse\n\nN++ is another, and apparantly the last entry in a momentum based platformer series that predates a lot of the other 'hardcore-hard' platformer games out there and it hasn't lost a bit of what makes the game good over the past 12 years. The premise of the game is that you are a ninja, ninjas like gold, and ninjas only live for 90 seconds in the absense of said gold. The narrative, like most of the rest of the game, is simple, and non-distracting.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around playing through a series of episodes, each containing 5 levels while only having 90 seconds to complete each episode. However, scattered around most of the levels in each episode are gold pieces that when collected add 2 seconds to your available pool of time to complete the episode. In most cases the gold is optional, but if you want any hope of competing on leaderboards you will need to collect as many if not all pieces along side of nearly perfect executing.\n\nAnd on the topic of execution, this game executes its simple gameplay masterfully. The movement is all momentum based, from running, jumping, and jumping off of walls/objects. Beating a level without keeping your momentum is possible for the most part, but the game really shines well when you try hold momentum for the entire level, while collecting as much gold as possible and not getting pommeled by any of the enemies (or slamming into any mines). Reaching max running speed takes a bit of time, mistiming jumps off of walls will reduce momentum, and most of your air control happens before you ever leave the ground. A very fine tuned system that offers a very high skill ceiling for people willing to shave milliseconds off of their level complete times.\n\nA system that is complimented well by it's level design. Every level takes place in spererate rooms that are all the same size, though the total playable area in each of these rooms can be much smaller. While not really offering anything amazing to the 2d platforming arena in regards to level mechanics, the wealth of available levels along with the difficulty of many of the later levels make up for it. Most of the levels follow a simple, less is better approach in that there is rarely a situation where you can not see how to complete a level before ever even starting it. With the exception of hidden mines and trap doors all the levels come down not to blindly attempting doors or jumps and instead urge you to focus purely on how you choose to execute it. That said, players will sometimes be rewarded if they can exectue perfectly timed jumps and high momentum moves with shortcuts or extra gold.\n\nGraphically the game is consistent in keeping with its simple themeing, but with that said, a lot of the themes seem too bright and or have too many clashing colors, but this is of course coming from someone who is used to playing the standard dark gray on light gray theme from the first game. No fancy textures, no crazy lighting effects, just simple, minimalist, and clean cut colors to comprise the floors and walls of each room you will find yourself in.\n\nMusically the game is fantastic as well, featuring a pounding drum-n-bass soundtrack that goes well with its gameplay. I actually wish there was an option to buy the soundtrack as well.\n\nThe built in level editor offeres for even more playability after completing the 2300+ levels including in the base game, though the editor is still a bit wonky, espeically compared to the one from the original game, though all the tools are there and it is still possible to make all kinds of brutal levels to punish the rest of the players with.\n\nTo summarize, N++ is another solid entry to the n series, offering way more levels than previous games, but still retaining that clear, simple-yet-hard gameplay approach that made this series what it is today. And the developer support for the game is strong to boot.", "timestamp_created": 1479948845, "timestamp_updated": 1480983095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "28171450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062330623", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 593, "last_played": 1719680370}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the original: N\n\nI loved the sequel: N+\n\nThis did not fail to impress me.\n\n\u2022 It is hard.\n\u2022 You will find yourself dying a lot. \n\u2022 You will obsess over getting every last piece of gold.\n\u2022 You will die even more trying to go for 100% completion\n\u2022 There are loads of secrets.\n\nI only played for 5 hours and it is already worth my money.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1480804431, "timestamp_updated": 1480805018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560585856437683105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "28168057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013452375", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1680843368}, "language": "english", "review": "I've said before, with some games, the beauty is in the simplicity. All you can do is run and jump...or that's all you have \"controls\" for. Where the game shines is the physics and how your speed can have a huge impact. Simply jumping in place might not get you anywhere but now go into a full run and suddenly you reach new heights...but oh, that's still not high enough? Well, you can jump off walls, essentially \"wall kicking\" like in Super Mario 64, but you can also press against the wall and slowly drag yourself down to slow your fall speed. Need that speed for a high jump on the other end of the level? Well, perhaps there's a ramp that you can safely land on at high speed to divert your momentum rather than splattering on a flat surface.\n\nThis is a game I didn't even know was in production. I played the original N (which is totally free from Metanet Software, so check that out if you're really not sure about this one) but I never knew they were working on a new one until I got an email sent for having an account on their website. N++ is everything the old N had and then some. The same familiar feel in a cleaner looking package, with more color options, more levels, and a huge soundtrack.\n\nWhen you are merely using 3 keys to control your character it feels greatly satisfying and fluid when you begin to master the physics of the game and pull off high speed wall kicks leading into other slick moves to gather all of the gold; which is something I haven't even mentioned yet! You have infinite lives, but each set of 5 levels are timed. The levels are just 1 screen and are full of traps, enemies, and gold. The gold increases the amount of time you have left and skipping too much of it may leave you without enough time to complete the last level. Getting all of the gold is generally the goal but it also allows you to essentially \"choose\" your own difficulty. Some of the early easy levels are very easy, but there may be a wealth of extra gold out of the way that you don't need to complete the level but you choose to get anyway for an all gold run. You always have the option to easily go back and play a set of levels over again. So if you don't feel you have the skills to do an all gold run, don't fret! You can always select those levels again right in the menu when you feel up for the challenge!\n\nLike the original N, N++ features a full level editor built right into the game, with access to all of the custom levels right in the games own menu. There are also leaderboards for all levels, even the tutorial and custom levels.\n\nIf you like fast paced platformers, especially if you are a masochistic completionist, I highly recommend this game! But if you are not a masochistic completionist, don't let that scare you, you can complete the levels without doing all the difficult gold runs, but you may just start to get a bit greedy yourself!", "timestamp_created": 1480792872, "timestamp_updated": 1480792872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "28152005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092621649", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1676786717}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1480734801, "timestamp_updated": 1480734801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "28134489", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968504478", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1721423085}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.

N++ has filled that void. \n\nIf you're looking for a game with:\nstory\na short experience\nhigh-def, ultra realistic graphics\nDLC\ndifficulty settings\n\nthen N++ is not the game for you. However, if you're like me, you don't care about any of these things and just want pure platforming, this game is a must add to your collection.\n\nSo far, I have no complaints with this game. The controls feel smooth and heavy, and platforming is less dependent on twitchy reflexes and more planning your jumps appropriately to conserve momentum. The levels (2500+ official levels!) are varied and well designed - from open arenas based on dodging rockets to linear pathways filled with mines, each level is designed to challenge but always fair. The game runs at a smooth 60fps, and although an option to increase the fps cap would be nice, it is perfectly playable at 60.

I just briefly mentioned the lack of online mutiplayer because people who liked the online multiplayer in N+ are obviously gonna wanna know that this game doesn't have it before they buy it. I actually barely care at all because I almost never played multiplayer. This disclaimer is here because whiny brats just read \"No multiplayer\", skipped the rest of the review, downvoted me 62 times for stating an objective fact, & whined in the comments.\n\nNo online multiplayer & the alleged reason sounds like complete nonsense. I have to wear headphones to have sound but the volume settings barely work until I lower them to 1, at which point, the game becomes almost inaudible.\n\nMost of the game is offscreen no matter what settings I use even though I don't have that problem with other games. This caused me to die in the intro level & I got an achievement for it called You Suck But That's Ok which is kind of like just lighting my money on fire, shitting on it, & throwing it at the screen. Good thing refunds exist.\n\nThis kind of thing isn't surprising considering the trailer is pointlessly painful to the eyes &, instead of fixing it, someone just put a seizure warning at the beginning of the trailer.\n\nEdit: Proof that this game has no excuse: The fact that the only way people can think of to argue with me is by obsessing over my acknowledgement of the lack of multiplayer, ignoring the rest of the review, & ignoring the fact that I said I don't personally care much about the multiplayer. You can't review a sequel to a multiplayer game without acknowledging the lack of multiplayer. Even if I gave the game a 10/10, I'd still have to acknowledge that problem because people who primarily played N+ in co-cop are obviously gonna wanna know that this game won't let 'em do that (except locally).

Its nice that they have multiplayer, but I was really hoping to get to play online. I was pretty disappointed when I found this out, and for most people this is situation specific. If you still play multiplayer locally then no worries!\n\nCharacter color. We can't figure out how to change our character's colors like we could in N+. I googled it and found some forums saying that you can't, although I'm not ruling it out, maybe it does exist. However if it doesn't I'm sad about that too. I liked the colors and their corresponding names. I was always Cherry bomb, and we still yell \"BANANA\" when my little brother dies in any game.\n\nSo, those two things are pretty miniscule, and specific to my personal taste.\n\nPro's. >>\n\nYou can color swap the whole game. They have themes that don't just change the look of menus, but the whole game itself. This is pretty rad. \n\nRacing. Multiplayer has coop like in N+ but they added in racing and this was the most fun we have had so far with it.\n\nAssasins. The lazers and missles you remember are back for another go. But, they are small fry compared to the new enemy assasins that spawn and kick yo ass!\n\nSo many levels. With the level creator and being able to share online there are more levels than you can ever hope to play. Now personally I have attempted to play additional levels in games like trackmania, and the majority are garbage, so this may have some gems but I bet it will take some digging. This is speculation though I have not really adventured outside of the base game levels yet.\n\nConclusion >>\nI loved N+. And I think what is bugging me has to do with the multiplayer. I just sort of feel let down. Its still fun, it looks sharp, controls are still crispy like bacon.

It offers a huge variety of levels on very different skill levels, varying from a casual experience to hardcore grinds to finish one.\n\nFirst thing I've noticed after launching the game were modes, you have a standard singleplayer platformer experience, but that's not it. There's also a CO-OP mode and race mode. The co-op mode is self explanatory, you plug another controller in, and play along a friend, the level design in those is pretty good, you often need both players to survive, and even if not they're really helpful to have around. The race mode is a bit weird, and I didn't have the chance to get into it fully at least yet, so there's not much I can say about it, but there's plenty of levels in it too.\n\nThe main part though, is definitely the singleplayer experience, where you have 3 tabs full of levels as of now (Ultimate Edition) and also intro levels tab. There are a lot of levels starting At A and ending on E all having 20 episodes consisting of 5 stages each. Then after you finish all those you get to move along to X row which is basically an expert challenge. I personally dislike the idea behind the episodes, as you have to beat all 5 during one playthrough to get the progress done, because when you beat one the level progress doesn't save, and you have to start an episode over, but that's a minor flaw.\n\nThe game is also movement based. It takes a while to get used to the \"slide-y\" movement, but it's actually very tight, and feels good, not being floppy whatsoever. There are coins scattered throughout all the levels, and the ninja collects them to get some more time for finishing the episode, but those can often be skipped without paying much attention to, because there's usually plenty of time. You can also try to collect them all, as it's often fun to go through an alternate route to gather some, and they provide a pretty tough additional challenge, though I suggest going for them after beating an episode, as you can only access a particular level after beating said episode.\n\nThe graphics and music fit together very well. The minimalistic artstyle goes along greatly with this soundtrack. The electronic beats make a great \"background noise\". There are also plenty of themes to play around with, as you unlock them by beating episodes. Only thing I wish was added would be a theme editor, as I don't think it'd be hard to implement and some of the themes are just straight up bad(For example light blue menu with lighter blue text).\n\nTo sum it up, there are some things I have issues with, such as boring waiting game levels with tough parts near the end that basically test the limits of your patience, and the episodic nature of the world hub which doesn't allow for easy quitting, but overall, the game is very good, the movement feels amazing, the physics feel very good once you get used to them and the soundtrack is great.", "timestamp_created": 1495210858, "timestamp_updated": 1495211334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "31835307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290470039", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 4850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1160, "last_played": 1729846752}, "language": "english", "review": "I RAGED SO HARD THAT I BROKE MY KEYBOARD\n\n\nNOW I CAN'T RAGE ANYMORE\n\n\n10/10 IGN", "timestamp_created": 1495175562, "timestamp_updated": 1495175562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512953341007232666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "31816184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139180514", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1489638793}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended", "timestamp_created": 1495082583, "timestamp_updated": 1495082583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480620145797729492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "31602163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018692526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1589, "last_played": 1511377369}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an augmented version of the freeware [url=http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/n.html]N[/url] (out there since 2004).

Each level is a chamber full of dangers / enemies, but the worst part is that you have a [b]lifetime[/b] (a timer set to 90 seconds).

You will never have the feeling of playing a raw, bad-made game. Never.\n\nThe amount of episodes (remember, one episode is a set of 5 levels) is 225 (tremendous) and, if you still want some, there's an [b]editor[/b] and a database containing all community-made levels.

The level design is perfect at inducing a sense of flow along with the music. Without having to collect the gold pieces or to beat levels quickly or to beat levels in a gauntlet without dying, it's an easy game for people who want to play it casually. Collecting the gold often forces a player to carefully balance their movement with two or more mechanics at once, and it's implemented brilliantly. For example, many levels require you to carefully balance on blocks that move with your weight as a laser homes in on you. Each level has a sense of motif, and challenge feels well-rewarded. Plenty of times a challenge ahead of me seemed tough, but not impossible, and the game has lulled me into spending 30+ minutes on specific levels to prove myself.\n\nPros:\n-Great accessibility for challenge-seekers and people who want to instantly delve into gameplay\n-Also a great game for casuals\n-Music\n-Designed with flow in mind\n-Level names are funny\n-Instantly launches the player back into the action after he dies\n\nCons:\n-Few types of obstacles exist in the game, and though all of them are used amazingly and in different ways throughout the game, there could be some more.\n-LET ME GET THAT LAST GOLD PIECE.

It was a free to play platformer that introduced a new style to the platforming genre. Unlike Mario N was a single screen platformer that had the player generating moves to keep up momentum to jump higher, farther, and overall faster. It also had a small puzzle mentality to it as well, such as waiting for the perfect time, opening a certain lock first, taking a particular path ect... The enemies were different as well, some that were passive and others that were aggressive and chased the player. This style gave us the beginning of a series that would redefine the platforming genre.\n\nA few years later in 2008 N+ was released on the XBLA (Xbox Live Arcade) store. At a glance it looked as if it was the same game from 2004 just with new levels and better graphics but you'd be wrong. It also added what many from the N community would say was the best decision they've ever made, Multiplayer... Now you and your friends could play a level together and complete the game together either through local co-op OR online play! This plus the addition of co-op levels, races, plus playing levels you and your friends created just added to the already amazing game play and made it more fun as well as chaotic!\n\nAnd now in 2016 N++ continues the legacy of the N series and again Improves on the fantastic game play! N++ now has new enemies such as the evil Ninja who follows your exact footsteps from 2 seconds ago as well as a ball of death that chases you down. N++ also adds new colors to the game to keep it fresh and gives it more eye candy as well. N++ adds another new feature which is the ability to browse levels made by anyone in the world where unlike N+ you could only play levels made by your friends.\n\nNow I know my review makes this game sound like the best game ever but unfortunately N++, while again improved from the last two games lacks one thing that made N+ one of the funnest platformers I've ever played, and that is online multiplayer... While co-op and racing levels are still in the game you can't play these with your friends online, you'll have to be in the same room together in order to do so. This saddens me due to the fact that if this game had multiplayer many more people would buy this game and it would also extend the life of this game too. HOWEVER, this is the only con that this game has. Don't let this one feature stop you from buying this amazing platformer, there's still a lot you can do on your own. And who knows, maybe they'll add online multiplayer to the game (one can only hope so :p).\n\nSo in conclusion, N++... Still my number 1 platformer and still a whole helluva lot a fun!\n\n10/10 would N++ again and forever!!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1474328918, "timestamp_updated": 1493351477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "31388320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122742011", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2312, "last_played": 1716069312}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favourite games of all time.

You may think the style is extremy simple and you know what, you're right! Its simple yet its so charming, you get tons of different palletes to choose from, different colors for your ninja and some accessories, the customization here for the levels alone is pretty damn solid that there's bound to be one that interests pretty much everyone, in general they have rather contrasting colors to have the level stand out. I think if it wasn't for such a simple artstyle, the developers not have as much content in the game, its a good compromise in my opinion. \n\nControls are solid, I mean SOLID. It has a floaty feeling yet has finesse and precision. You feel like you have complete control over when your character starts and stops both up and down and left and right, I have yet to find a game that manages to balance it out as well as this one does. The momentum mechanic works really well, your character feels like it has force applied to it when you run and jump, jumping off of walls and gaining speed. Its so satisfiying!\n\nThe amount of content you get for this game is absurd, I've already put 5 hours into it and I haven't even scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. It does not descriminate, whatever way you choose to play is here. Want to speedrun? Got it, collect them all for that completionist side of you? Right here! Want to take it nice and steady, go at at reasonable pace and not care about speedrunning or collecting? The game has you covered, in fact the time it gives to complete a level is generous, I have not once found myself even when I was taking my sweet sweet time to fail a level because the timer ran out. The developers promise 100+ hours and so far I believe them on that, even just completing the solo mode itself will take you I'd say a solid 20-30 hours if you don't touch the rest of the content or collect anything and just rush through it, you've already got more than what you paid for. Heck I remember when we paid 60 dollars for triple A games for 8 hours. 8 HOURS!\n\nBesides the solo mode as I mentioned it also has hardcore which is basically your time attack mode in which you try to complete a level as fat as possible, you're given a reasonable starting time and from there it stacks if you collect the orange squares. Feeling brave? Do hardcore without going for the orange squares and that right there will be an extra challenge.\n\nTHEN, you also have the level creator, yes I am not done yet. You've got thousands upon thousands of user made levels, granted some of them aren't up to snuff with the content the devs provided, it further expands the playability of this game beyond what you'd imagine for a 15 dollar game.\n\nHave I mentioned the soundtrack yet? No? Well I must!!! The soundtrack is absolutly superb, its a combination of electronic with slow relaxed drum and base tones with some occasional chillstep, it is incredible, it really goes hand in hand with the gameplay.\n\nDon't miss this game! I nearly gave it a pass because I thought it was going to be a rather bland experience yet everytime I jump in, I feel so compelled to sink hours of my life into it. Like a tube of pringles, once you start you won't stop. ;)\n\nScore: 10/10.

I have also played this for about 20 hours on the PS4.\n\nIf you play this game, you will die. You think you died in Bloodborne? You think the bosses in Dark Souls 3 can kill you in a couple of hits? Lol. Just lol. People complaining that other games kill them too easily have never played N++. This is a game so nightmarishly difficult that, according to websites which track Steam achievements, no-one has obtained some of the achievements in N++. No-one. Worldwide. And it's the same on the PS4. \n\nThis does not mean the achievements are \"exclusive\", it means the game has been designed in such a way that people simply cannot get them, which is poor design - what's the point in having achievements nobody can actually achieve? If you try some of the later levels you may well find some of them impossible, or simply too annoying. The maps with lots of \"evil clones\" of your character in particular are very frustrating. Some maps are so overloaded with moving things that I start feeling migrainey and struggle to \"understand\" the map. Missiles are no longer the only things that will kill a skilled player.\n\nIf you liked N+ and have waited impatiently for a sequel, this is its bigger, badder brother. The way each element is employed in N++ results in a tougher and longer experience (although including N+'s maps seems like a cheap way to claim \"we have over a thousand levels\"). \n\nThe physics seem a bit improved, but realistically, I find they don't make too much sense, and you can die in unexpected ways, such as hitting a ramp at speed (which will either kill you or save your life). The annoying bouncing boxes with their weird effect on your jumping are still present. I'm quite good at the game (although far from a world-beater) and have got pretty far, and I reckon at least half of all my deaths have been due to the weird, annoying physics, which can cause the controls to be unresponsive for a split second and your ninja to move in unexpected ways. Clipping a wall with your feet does this a lot. Your ninja is not particularly nimble. However, if you thought the way momentum works in the original Super Mario Brothers was superlative, you will love the physics of N++. (Cue someone pretending to be a physics professor who will elaborate on how \"accurate\" and \"convincing\" the game is.)\n\nNote that nothing else in the game is affected by the physics, so you still see rockets performing super-tight turns which you will never match, and the reload time for a new missile is still less than a second.\n\nThere are a ton of secrets in the game but I think most people will miss nearly all of them. You can unlock a super-hard swathe of maps if you complete every single level in the game, although again, most people will have given up far before this point. Not every map or episode has walkthroughs on Youtube if that's your bag, so again, you lose out. I am led to believe that some of the \"secrets\" are simply harder versions of existing maps, and if that's correct, is it really worth bothering with?\n\nThe map editor is a bit overwhelming, I didn't find it nearly as simple or intuitive as N+'s, but if you can harness it, you will be able to make some truly stunning efforts. A pity there appears to be no real management of user content online as most of the maps are simply impossible for the average (or even the good) player. It would be brilliant if there was an option to play or download easier episodes, so you can just kick back and have fun. Still, you can make some genuinely fun stuff for your friends. I haven't uploaded anything yet so don't know if you can do an episode, as you could in N+.\n\nSo why am I giving this the thumbs up? Well, I'll go on record as saying at least 75% of the maps range from being quite enjoyable to downright amazing to play. The sheer scale of imagination, when the game is actually built from very few components, is stunning. Even the moronically difficult maps, the ones which bring your enjoyment to a crashing halt, are so well designed they border on genius. I can overlook the sometimes questionable physics and the weird momentum quirks if the maps are fast-paced and exciting enough. Playing with friends, even if they just spectate, can be hilarious, and defeating a particularly trollworthy map feels epic beyond belief. Easy maps can make you look like some kind of genius player, and for all the bad luck you'll have, the occasional snatch of brilliant luck can make for a superb replay.\n\nTl;dr - flawed, occasionally super-hard well past the point of deliberate trolling, but extremely fun, engaging and exciting, with a very powerful level editor. It's the perfect way to kill a spare ten minutes. Or two hours.

It builds upon the classic style dating all the way back to the first iteration of N but gives you a plethora of color pallets to choose from in a slick UI. Very minimalist but beautiful to look at none the less. The soundtrack suits the frenetic and super challenging gameplay well and is one of the best I have heard in recent years, up there with the likes of the more recent furi and timeless hotline miami series. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nExpect to die a lot. This is the kind of game where you will die... again... and again. It demands perfection and when you get it right it just feels so good. The controls are momentum based and once you get used to them give you a lot of freedom to move around the level with certain restrictions that keep it challenging such as height and speed... I've killed myself running into a wall too fast.\n\n[b]Content[/b]\nIf you have played older versions of this and are wondering if you should pick it up or not... I would say if you are a fan absolutely. Its got all the levels from previous versions N and N+ and a whole slew of new levels, developer made and fan made. There is steam workshop integration with a built in level editor so essentially you will never run out of new things to play. It is the most complete version of the game and is packed to the brim with old and new content.\n\n[b]CONCLUSION[/b]\nThis is not an easy game but damn is it a fun game. The multiplayer, whether versus or coop, Is a blast. The single player seems endless with how many levels there are. It expands upon previous iterations on just about any way imaginable and it does what it does well.

Fans of Super Meat Boy and the like will enjoy its hard difficulty and the insane amount of levels the game has to offer (2,360 of them, as a matter of fact, [i]not including user-made levels (!)[/i]). The physics can take a bit of getting used to, as N++ feels a little floatier than Super Meat Boy and other platformers, but gameplay is very fluid  overall. The pacing varies from level to level, ranging from careful and methodical planning to \"run-as-fast-as-you-freaking-can\", and resetting a level from the inevitable death or two (hundred) is almost instant. The art style is very crisp and not too busy for the eyes, and the range of colors that you unlock as you progress through the game give you something different to look at, which helps in changing things up and keeping the game looking fresh.\nTo top it off, the soundtrack is perfect for a game like N++. The soundtrack is an assortment of ambient IDM-style tracks which all manage to pull off the difficult task of giving the game atmosphere while not being distracting at the same time. Also, as mentioned above, there are user-created levels for those looking for a challenge or something new. N++ also has a cooperative mode and a competitive racing mode (local only).\n\nFor fans of the previous N games, this game is a no-brainer. This game is a must-have for fans of difficult platformer games.

We need more developers in the game industry that actually care what the community thinks. Kudos to you man!\n\nI was on the fence with this game.\n\nI played the first N+ for hours and absolutely loved it. Now that I've played this game for quite some time I will try to point out the main differences that I see and feel in the game as quickly as possible.\n\nControls:  \n-Jumping is inconsistent at times\n-Games seems more slippery(ie sliding into bombs when trying to stop)\n-Good news is you can jump on pointy geometry now\n\nObjects:\n-Missiles have a tighter turn radius, which was just annoying in my opinion\n-Bombs are bigger and have a active/inactive state to them\n-Bouncy Blocks are WAY different from the first game. Different point at which to jump to get maximum lift\n\nHit detection: This part I think is what frustrated me the most, apart from the controls not being consistent. I found that the top of your character is not really the top of your character.  It's almost as if your head doesn't count as part of your body. This is nice for some levels, but more frustrating than it is helpful.  You can no longer graze a switch with the top of your head and have it activate. Your movements need to be more explicit when hitting time and switches.\n\nCollecting Time: I found myself never needing to go after time which made the game easier than I was hoping. I can only remember 1 time when I NEEDED to get some time or I wasn't going to complete the level. Most of the challenging parts of the levels you can skip because they involve collecting time that your really don't need.  The only reason to go for it is to get higher on the leader board. \n\nThe developer did include the legacy levels from the first game in this one which I have to commend. \n\nOverall it's not a bad game, its just different from the first game in ways that are frustrating more than challenging and fun.\n\nI would recommend you buy this game on sale if you want a challenging platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1487735221, "timestamp_updated": 1487896525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491315782070159912", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "30127287", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993244209", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 164886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 140, "playtime_at_review": 25127, "last_played": 1741584257}, "language": "english", "review": "You have to give some of yourself to this game, but it will give you so much in return. It's as deep and as hard as you want it to be. There has never been a platformer with more rewarding physics.\n\n\nPlease forgive its sometimes-clunky menus.\n\n\nA couple things to be aware of:\n\n- The userlevel community is great! It's easy to just totally not notice behind the innocuous-looking \"Browse\" menu item, but making levels, playing new levels as they come in, and competing on the weekly featured levels are where I spend easily half my time with the game. Don't miss it!\n\n- If you care about high scores, which is a great thing to do, make sure you turn on the \"submit level scores\" option so you don't lose your level runs when you do full episodes. It's kind of a historical accident that it defaults to off. Hopefully this will be fixed in the next update.\n\n- Race mode and Coop are *really good*. There's no online multiplayer, so you'll have to find someone to play with, but they are good enough that some hardcore players have literally flown internationally to play with each other :D\n\n- Come hang out with us in the public discord!

I think my least favorite aspect of this game is the level design. To put it simply, Metanet has gone to the more, 'ragequit-worthy' aspects of game design. Most of the difficult levels follows these exact format: \n1. Enemy spam, where there are a bunch of enemies, usually drones and mini drones, placed in an inconsistent manner, which becomes difficult to navigate through, since you can't really predict their path.\n2. A bunch of evil ninjas, and you have to go around a path that eventually cross theirs.\n3. And one of my least favorites, they literally make the ending of the level very difficult, like a narrow mine-filled path to the door, but the entire level is long, so you have to do everything all over again just to succeed on that particular part. C'mon, seriously? That's lame. You could do better than that.\nI do admit though, making thousands of level is a hell of a task, and it ain't easy. But that doesn't mean I accept those levels though, They are just though, not fun at all. In contrast to the original N, there are plenty of though levels, but I actually enjoy playing them. Like that one level called \"Mother Thumping Impossible\", I don't know if ya'll know, that's hard as hell, but i enjoy it. They are hard, but they don't have that, \"ragequit-worthy\" vibe to it. Maybe it's because of the designs of the levels. I think the designs in N++ are all too, monotone, while putting those rage-enducing factors to it. Where as in the original N, they are simplistic, but have their own quirks to it. Beside all that though? This game is sleek as hell! It's obviously more polished. I enjoyed it, but I think the best part of this game is the level design. Now that's addicting.

although my interest in the game is an oddity, it doesn't feel like i particularly am, yet i've continued to play it. it's almost all gameplay and, if you like the gameplay, you have plenty of levels available to play through (provided you have the time to get through most of them,) and if you don't, there's not too much else to encourage playing any further. i'm still going to recommend the game if it sounds interesting, as, i think it's mostly just an issue of maybe(?) not entirely appealing to me at the moment, and there's nothing i'd really feel like i'd think \"should\" be changed, as it'd conflict with n++'s identity, with the exception of the palettes being applied automatically as they're hovered over. it's genuinely sickening scrolling through the list, and i'm not sure if you can change that. that said, i will still be talking about it, to an extent.\n\nsome levels i enjoyed, others i didn't really feel much about. i think that the controls are very sensitive to pressing something a little shorter, or longer than intended \u2014 they're incredibly variable, and the effects on a given result is very noticeable. there's very little you can do to fix a mistake once it's in motion, and, otherwise minor deviations from your expected trajectory can also prove to be quite dangerous, depending on the obstacle you were facing. i'd like to be able to play out such situations further, to try and correct it in some way, but, that's not really possible, and would end up changing the feel of the game significantly.\n\nthe movement/controls can feel a bit inconsistent with such a large range of possible values, and potentially influenced to a massive degree by your speed in any direction. if a level asks for a consistent level of precision, this particular feeling shows prominently. to know, or have a plan on how to do something, and to be coming up short of fulfilling it; not always due to a error in planning, but some near minute flaw in execution. having a tiny slope or corner entirely halt a held jump input could be an example of this, or coming up short on a wall jump, only to entirely overshoot it the next time you try it, with very little difference in input. even so, the unique physics are rather interesting, even if they feel a bit strange at times, particularly when you're tripping over corners.\n\nconsistent precision, is usually something that the later levels might ask of you now and again, as most of the levels have a decent amount of leniency, of course. mines, and other hazards have some rather large contact zones, and are far from generous towards you. additionally, i think the level select screen makes it unclear as to whether or not it wants you to go across rows or down columns, as you get an achievement per row, but hardcore mode has you go down per column, which [i]seems[/i] to ramp up the difficulty more smoothly(?), although, it's still hard to tell.\n\nit's very self directed, you get to choose which episodes to play, if you want to go down columns or skip across several, if you want to bother with collecting gold, or going quickly, or smoothly. when to stop with a level and try another, or to keep going. there's very little given to guide you, other than the basic controls and intro levels. this freeformity is nice, but it can also make it feel like something is missing, occasionally. trying and trying a level again and again, particularly if it's an issue in precisely inputting something has a specific feeling with it; you've done enough planning to get you through the level, and, you'll inevitably get through it, once things line up correctly, and, after a certain point, can either make you think about nothing at all, or other things entirely, provided you don't get stuck in your own head. \n\nhow much you enjoy those feelings, or what you tend towards feeling in particular is going to vary between people, of course. i'd personally like to focus my thoughts on the game itself, but, it doesn't really seem to lend itself to really thinking about it for an extended period of time. you can take in a new level, come up with ideas, plans and movement to get through it, or try to solve some of the unique challenges presented by it, and then all you're left with is actually doing it. trying again and again after that, i'm sure can be pleasant, or relaxing for some, but, is not quite something i'm looking for out of this game; it just makes me feel kind of anxious, which, i'm sure is far from the intended feeling, but is what has been happening. the way the movement can flow is nice, but you really have to go out of your way to be able to utilise it well in some of the more enclosed, or mine-filled environments.\n\nwhile some of this might sound a bit harsh, i will say that most of the levels so far have felt enjoyable, with some maybe feeling a bit less so than others. a feeling perhaps partially due to the combination of the unguided nature of the game, and some levels having some rather unforgiving ideas as to what should be done to make it feel difficult.\n\nadditionally, i don't think rebinding the controls to the numpad works quite correctly. numpad 5 doesn't seem to input anything, at least in regards to a down input, and numpad 8, bound to jump, wouldn't allow me to start any replays. i'm repeating this a second time as it does particularly bother me, the palettes automatically applying as you scroll through them is pretty sickening, and i'm unsure if it's possible to change that, so, be really careful with that.\n\nthat is, about how i feel about it. some of it might be incomprehensible due to being tired!", "timestamp_created": 1734378052, "timestamp_updated": 1742107328, "voted_up": true,

Left, right, and jump, which is a hold input meaning the longer you hold, the higher you jump, and same goes for tapping. Movement left or right functions in a similar way. You have friction and momentum, walljumping, sliding down sloped surfaces, and all of it is under your control. There isn't anything but the forces of gravity controlling you.\n\nThe look of the game is incredibly variable thanks to its visual design, you can apply any number of color schemes and it still works, some better than others though. Timeless visual design that will look good forever.\n\nI recommend going through the legacy levels first if you hadn't completed the original flash game. All of those levels are there, just in a scrambled order. It's not like the ordering of the levels matter much though.\n\nOverall I recommend. Even if you don't like platformers, at least give this a try. If you don't feel like buying it yet, you can download the original Flash release on the website, and get a feel for it there.

Yeah, 10 minutes. And no, it wasn\u2019t luck, and it wasn\u2019t a fluke. I\u2019m just built different when it comes to video games. People keep saying stuff like, \"Oh, you just got lucky,\" but they don\u2019t realize how good I actually am. There\u2019s no luck involved when you\u2019re this skilled. The game itself is alright. The graphics are good, I\u2019ll give it that. Like, the levels looks cool and all, and the colour palette options are kinda neat. But, honestly, I didn\u2019t spend much time admiring it because, you guessed it, I beat it in 10 minutes. The premise is super simple: reach the exit door. That\u2019s it. No crazy storylines, no unnecessary dialogue, just platforming. And let me tell you, I platformed. Fast. Like, 10 minutes fast. One of the coolest features, though, is this timer thing. While you\u2019re playing, you can pull up a timer to see how long it\u2019s taking you to beat the game. Spoiler alert: it took me 10 minutes. It\u2019s actually kinda funny because it\u2019s like the devs knew people like me would absolutely destroy their game in record time. So, thanks for the timer. It\u2019s a solid reminder that I\u2019m just better. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014Steam is bugging. My account says I have 467 hours on this game. FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN. That\u2019s not true at all. I beat it in 10 minutes. Steam, fix your software, because these stats are lying to everyone. I don\u2019t need people thinking it took me 467 hours to finish something I crushed in 10 minutes. The gameplay? It\u2019s fine. The controls work, the physics are smooth, blah blah blah. But honestly, I didn\u2019t even get to fully appreciate the mechanics because I finished so fast. Like, I just zoomed through the whole thing. It\u2019s not my fault the game was too easy for me. It\u2019s probably tough for other people, but I\u2019m not other people. I beat it in 10 minutes. To wrap this up: the game\u2019s cool, the graphics are nice, and the timer feature is dope. But the real highlight here is me beating the entire thing in 10 minutes. So, if you\u2019re up for the challenge, try it out, but good luck beating my time. You probably won\u2019t.\n\nAnd Steam, if you\u2019re reading this, fix your broken playtime tracker. I didn\u2019t spend 467 hours here.

It's just a really solid game, a laser-focused take on platforming that has clearly been refined to perfection since the early Flash days. I like how you go from \"the physics are kinda janky\" to \"ah dang I was a pixel to the left, that was entirely my fault\" in a matter of hours, the movement and controls really grow on you.\n\nHaving the ability to customize the pallete and change the soundtrack at any time is pretty neat, the hundreds of hand-crafted levels are generally very fun to play and you feel really good either just getting to the exit or collecting all the gold pieces. Back in the day, I would also probably rave about the level creation and community content (which is nice), but it's not something that I care too much about now.\n\nFinally, I just think in today's landscape it's just really nice to play a game that focuses on doing one thing and doing it very well. A lot of stuff gets stretched too thin between styles and subsystems, so games like N++ definitively make you appreciate how much enjoyment you can still get from simple, straightforward 2D platforming.", "timestamp_created": 1733017407, "timestamp_updated": 1733017407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518716573715209961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "181111523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212902445", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 332, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1742574809}, "language": "english", "review": "yeah it's video games", "timestamp_created": 1732988851, "timestamp_updated": 1732988851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449293971061706543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "179904168", "author": {"steamid": "76561199284027176", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1742653288}, "language": "english", "review": "its REALLY BIG", "timestamp_created": 1732710778, "timestamp_updated": 1732710778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487096786499023438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "179746221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198927591240", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1703, "last_played": 1732500046}, "language": "english", "review": "a true classic of the genre. best platformer out there", "timestamp_created": 1732477163, "timestamp_updated": 1732477163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487096786499023438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "179554556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119052027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1601, "last_played": 1712087603}, "language": "english", "review": "Man jump", "timestamp_created": 1732260984, "timestamp_updated": 1732260984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429975420236587524", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "179344130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176927357", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 458, "deck_playtime_at_review": 1, "last_played": 1731359551}, "language": "english", "review": "Rating: 10/10\n\nClassic platformer, simple in the controls but complex in the movement.

Feels just the right amount of floaty with a lot of ability for expression through movement.\n[*] Ridiculous amount of depth to movement, especially for something as simple as a game with only three buttons (left, right, jump).\n[*] Many mechanics and enemies actually have some of their own depth too, even though on the surface they appear quite straightforward. Rockets are actually phenomenal and super interesting.\n[*] Absurdly impressive amount of levels and stuff to do; 100%ing N++ is a difficult task, and takes most people around 800 hours minimum\n[*] Episodes/levels are structured in a way that results in you always having something to do or to strive for. Along with community levels, if you want to play N++, you will always have something you can do at any skill level.\n[*] The ability to not be able to do something no matter how hard you try, then come back much later after you've gotten better and nail it in a few attempts is a constant. few other games make me feel as good as I do when that happens\n[*] Amazing soundtrack\n[*] Tons of levels, customization, color palettes\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Cons[/h2]\n[h3]General[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Songs do not have permanent license with the game, so at some point songs will be removed from the game in patches. This has already happened. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990677762]You can downpatch to get the music back though.[/url]\n[*] The soundtrack is also not for sale anywhere. If you want to buy the entire soundtrack, you'd have to go to multiple different Bandcamps and websites to purchase all the tracks (some of them are not even publicly available anymore btw). After all of that, you'd probably be down about $200. [spoiler]slsk is a good program![/spoiler]\n[*] [b]Secret challenges[/b]. Holy fuck, the intended system for these SUCKS. I'll just link [url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/186604-n-plus-plus/faqs/76503]this guide[/url] because explaining it means the review hits the character limit. TL;DR, It's esoteric, annoying, absurdly difficult, and time-wasting. The actual challenges are fun (usually), but discovering them is not.\n[*] Some levels/secret challenges are total misses. SU-X-02-04 \"losing ground\" is one solid example; it's 60 seconds of nothing and then the actual hard part. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbtEJ2Ckxw4]\"temerity\" G--T++ is 60 seconds of pure waiting.[/url]\n[*] Episodes sometime seem randomly scattered around without much thought for difficulty and progression.\n[/list]\n[h3]Multiplayer[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] There is NO ingrained online multiplayer. The only multiplayer you can do is Steam Remote Play which means that your friend's save does not progress while yours does. [b]So in order for a Co-Op pair to fully complete N++ on their respective machines, you MUST do all of Co-Op TWICE[/b] (which is a monumental task). There is also a Race mode which was built around multiplayer, which has the same issue. Thankfully, you can complete this solo but it takes all of the fun out of the mode. It's best to do this with multiple friends but... good luck with that.\n[*] Community is hit or miss. To complete Co-Op, you're basically required to join the official Discord to find another player to play with, and even then you have to find someone who's willing to progress on YOUR save file AND who is also in a region close enough to you to not cause significant input delay. As time passes, this just becomes harder and harder of a task.\n[*] On a related note, the Official Discord community can be quite awful. I've seen some of the 100%ers tell minors to kill themselves while mods don't give a shit. Multiple users made fun of a 14y/o kid who used emojis in his messages \"too often\". There's this one extremely self-hating dude named Renard who made it his life's mission to annoy and harass me (spoiler alert: he just hated himself so he lashed out at a stranger). Some people are just straight up [i]strange[/i]. It's something you don't want to actively involve yourself in; if you're looking for a sense of community, go literally anywhere else. I'm not going to say there AREN'T nice people there (there were a couple of nice people I enjoyed talking to, s/o Emmoji, Doc, xela, Nova, and eyre), but it's the best of a bad bunch.\n[/list]\n[h3]QoL[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Cannot bind multiple keys to one action. This is important for some late game mashing that is required for certain secret challenges.\n[*] No option to save all successful replays. Which is really lame. Incredibly useful since you might wanna replay a successful secret challenge attempt but your all-gold run overrides it because it's technically a better score and therefore doesn't save.\n[*] No option to replay your latest death.\n[/list]\n[h3]Bugs[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1821198112]Saves have a tendency to corrupt.[/url] Saves tend to not work with the Steam Cloud, and it's recommended to keep the Cloud off. You need to keep manual backups, as your save can corrupt for no reason at any time. The game does not keep backups for you. In 348 hours, it hasn't happened to me, but it could at any moment.\n[*] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuKuqh7b3M]Your dead body colliding with enemies can destroy your ears because parts can become stuck inside of enemies.[/url]\n[*] Can't view replays during an episode. Apparently, you weren't supposed to be able to view a replay of a level before you beat the episode either (which you can). I really don't like this, because you either view the replay for a level you can't figure out or you just look it up on YouTube. The extra intended barrier just does not seem appealing from a player's standpoint.\n[*] Profile menu has a bug where it won't display progress correctly.\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2566075839]Issues displaying on certain high resolutions[/url]\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3266759653]Game will display sharper on certain languages[/url] (German is sharper compared to English)\n[*] Replays are 5.5% slower than actual gameplay. I experienced this odd bug when I tried to make a video syncing a replay with a game recording's audio.\n[*] Extremely loud on first launch (as in, when you first install the game)\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nThis game is phenomenal. I know it sounds like I hate it, but I really just hate aspects of it. I wouldn't have put 350 hours into something that I didn't enjoy. N++ is a great game, but it makes a couple decisions that have me scratching my head trying to wonder what they were thinking at points. It's got a couple of really screwed up and strange bugs, a mostly fucked up community, and a serious lack of some QoL features.\nBut it's a fucking fantastic platformer. There is truly nothing else like it. It captures such a delicious style and vibe that other platformers don't really go for. This game is absolutely in a league of its own, and it's dominating.\n\n[url=https://isthereanydeal.com/game/nplusplus/info/]Buy on sale.[/url]\n\nHere's hoping for open source release in 2025.", "timestamp_created": 1689178594, "timestamp_updated": 1729209950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "37969368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095027378", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 164629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 207, "playtime_at_review": 161114, "last_played": 1742000376}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi! You don't need to read all of this, I wrote it after 100%ing the game when I was still very emotionally vulnerable (and hormonally everywhere, as growing up will do to you). I'm keeping it all here because it snapshots my feelings really well, but tl;dr:\n\nIt is the world's best platformer, for real. There [i]really is[/i] nothing else like this.\nAnyways, here's the rest:\n\nIt's difficult to explain my experience with this game.\nYes, it's what it is on the tin: the most refined pure platforming experience ever made. It's good. It's really, really, unnecessarily long, but almost every single aspect of the gameplay is perfect. And yet, a part of me still kind of hates it, even if it was me who decided that I should go all the way to the end. Its hugeness can be really imposing on the rest of your Steam library, and its slowness can dissuade a player from leaving the game alone for too long, lest they become unadjusted from it.\n(I did 100% it, as you can tell by the obscene hourcount, but it wasn't as severe as it first might appear: that was over the course of four years. In reality, it amounted to about one or two hours a day - though, knowing myself, it's more like that the days I chose to play, I averaged three.)\nLet's go back a bit. It's impossible to describe the experience I had without going back to where I first discovered N++ specifically - betatesting the Mac version of the game (and I'm so so so sorry for that one terrible bug, I really should have said something about it or at least noticed it sooner) via a public thread on the Steam forums. One thing leads to another, and I end up in the Discord server for the game. I don't think there's any other game where you can actively document your progress, share your custom maps and access a broad highscoring platform for literal years in the same way N++ does. And, to be honest, I hope there never is. The community is wonderful over there, but I think after so much, I can only feel exhausted. I don't have much left to say about it. I started when I was 14, and I'm 18 now.\nMare and Raigan are wonderful people, by the way. I'm not! Thanks for putting up with me.\nWait, this is a review, I'm supposed to talk about the actual game.\nWell, the main campaign, aka the \"N++ tab\" is perfect. The Ultimate tab is a bit less interesting to me personally, but I think it has moments that justify the doubling of the size of the game. Legacy feels somewhat vestigal, though. I'm not really a fan of the episode structure, either; I had much more fun with the [spoiler]nonlinear insanity that is the two secret tabs, ESPECIALLY the latter.[/spoiler]. As for [spoiler]the thousands of \"secret challenges\", aka \"complete the level [i]like this[/i][/spoiler], I would say... there's a very big portion that are good, and a slightly smaller but still noticable section that are \"just okay\". There isn't really anything in the game that I would say compares to any major challenge in another game, it's just a very, very big slope of difficulty.\nThere's also a \"Hardcore mode\" in the game where you complete 25 levels in a row with time carrying over. There are completion points for doing these deathless. I hated it, because the way the levels are structured make all of the 65 \"hardcore stories\" have backloaded difficulty. It wasn't fun, and although people tell me that I'm not justified because I highscored many of them as I did the nodeath, I felt personally that if I didn't do something to keep myself occupied as I tried this, I would probably go insane.\nCo-op and Race are extremely fun. Use Parsec and find a good partner on the Discord.\nUserlevels by the community in general are very good, but the ones you'll see in Newest currently are occupied by (possibly more than one) braindead child who was left alone with a Nintendo Switch, ALMOST EVERY DAY. (Seriously, please just fucking get rid of him. I'm not going to be subtle about this, this isn't worth anyone's while.) Besides that, I'm happy to have met so many talented artists, architects and otherwise. They have definitely inspired me, more than the server probably understands.\nThe game only has UI bugs, no gameplay bugs. But the UI bugs the game has, and the one major bug on the Mac version, happen to be so massively inconvenient it can be heartbreaking sometimes - because the game is otherwise so good. I played 90% of the game on a now decade-old laptop, so that should tell you about what the game can handle. It's extremely optimized C++ code - you'll have a good time playing and the devs would literally have to go to hell and back to fix anything. Including the 100% achievements. God fucking damn it, I feel bad because I was supposed to help fix that, too. Maybe I'll do it after writing this review.\n\ntl;dr It's a rollercoaster. Don't play it if you value your Steam achievements (f++king get over it, nobody cares). Don't play it if you intend to finish everything you touch, in fact, don't even play it if you intend to finish it.

It's not the best game on steam for any one particular thing. It doesn't have the deepest, most tear-jerking story on the market. It doesn't have the most insane mechanics with the highest ceiling of technical skill. It doesn't have a soundtrack or art that keeps you staring in awe. It's just a simple platformer. Collect coins, avoid death, get to the end. Sounds boring? No.\n\nThat's what makes it perfect.\n\nN++ is just a platformer, but it does that aspect REALLY well. It feels fluid, smooth, and easy to pick up. N++ has easy enough levels to ease newbies to the genre, and fun level design that keeps casuals playing. But it also has some insanely difficult levels with high precision, or the option to 100% complete the game or speedrun levels fighting for highscore for hardcore veterans of the genre. If you enjoy platformers, you'll enjoy N++.  Sometimes, making a game that appeals to a wider audience reduces from what makes the game unique. N++ would be less of a game if it had a deep story, less fun if it had extra crazy movement tech. N++ doesn't overstretch what it is, because sometimes jack-of-all-trades is less interesting and unique, and your core audience will enjoy it less.\n\nThe soundtrack is often very minimal, only supplementing the gameplay, which is perfect for the vibe the game was attempting to portray. The art is mainly color schemes, and there's a lot of them (personally use the dark mode a lot.) All of this is done to highlight the gameplay itself, and rather than subtracting from it, all of these work with it to further enhance it. It's a big step up from N and N+ some 20 years ago.\n\nBut a platformer is only as good as the levels it's built on. And there it also shines. The levels are charming, and with a level-editor, it always has room for more improvement. The amount of levels you get at the BASE level is already insanely high, adding more via level-editor and sharing them with friends or others always feels fun.\n\nN++ is, simply put, the epitome of good platforming. Platformer incarnate. If I ever want to suggest a platformer to someone, and don't know their taste in games, N++ is the first one to come to mind.", "timestamp_created": 1728617479, "timestamp_updated": 1729030415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572368443012237549", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}, {"recommendationid": "176957603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045971681", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 2796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2368, "last_played": 1729903574}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most refined, pure gameplay-focused platformers in existence.
