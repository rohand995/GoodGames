Quake 3 is one of the best arena shooters ever made. Unlike Quake Champions, it does not require online play or connection, and doesn't take forever to load, and has almost no hiccups on an old machine. Online play can be awesome, but get some friends to play or brace yourself for a world of hurt. The game has some great bot competition if you don't feel like getting stomped (although you can set them pretty high, and there are mods to improve them). Quake Live I believe is basically Quake 3, but there is no singleplayer campaign, there has been an attempt to smooth out item placement and there are some more modern maps.\n \nThere are lots of mods, maps and characters. A bunch of really excellent community maps. Lots of folks play this with a mod engine, which will allow some bending of the memory requirements of an old game and if you want fancy graphics. But the gameplay is great regardless. You can sample the gameplay with Open Arena for free, and if you like it but want a more brown and grey gothic nightmare aesthetic, then Quake 3 is pretty cheap to pick up, especially on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1691461392, "timestamp_updated": 1693893146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57691645622253418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "145680524", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993236050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1640132957}, "language": "english", "review": "\"You played Quake 3 Arena for 17 minutes\" is hilarious for Several Reasons.", "timestamp_created": 1693868266, "timestamp_updated": 1693868266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "145651480", "author": {"steamid": "76561199210097933", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1538, "last_played": 1723383943}, "language": "english", "review": "Guns go brrrr", "timestamp_created": 1693832075, "timestamp_updated": 1693832075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "145638109", "author": {"steamid": "76561199008966367", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1724701009}, "language": "english", "review": "this game really makes you feel like a badass", "timestamp_created": 1693808305, "timestamp_updated": 1693808305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "145623470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071430858", "num_games_owned": 1195, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1530115850}, "language": "english", "review": "Xaero Spawn Camp Simulator 1999\u2122", "timestamp_created": 1693781999, "timestamp_updated": 1693781999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564693808555603027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "110818573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001304794", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 530, "playtime_forever": 1659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 642, "last_played": 1734225475}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing this game since i was 8 years old and it's such a classic. Best game to experience Arena Shooters, with uniquely crafted levels with layouts that are fresh, interesting and easy to remember. All the weapons feel so satisfying to use with the Shotgun, Plasma Gun,Railgun and Lightning Gun being my fav in design and sound, all power ups feel so nice to use too such as Quad Damage and Haste, all the characters have a cool designs that fits the levels they are featured in aswell as cameo's from other ID Software games and developers themselves too.\n\nOne of the unique features to this game would be the see through teleporters, so almost all teleporters will show you the location they will send you to, just by staring at it and it even acts in real time making you able to see players through it aswell as weapons so sometimes you can even watch a battle happening and you can either join in on it or wait till there is 1 player left to finish the job. Another game to have this feature would be Prey 2006 and it basically got that idea and turned it into an entire game with it being a main focus which is really cool. \n\nAlot of players still host servers so if you're interested in playing online you should be able to find a couple of servers as people are really dedicated to this game and it shows how much of impact it has had on people to the point where they want to keep it alive by running servers still till this day.\n\nHighly recommend for those who are into Arena Shooters or want to get into them, as this game is the perfect introduction to it.\n\nPS.

Since it is old though, if you are playing on a modern monitor you'll need to do some tweaking to fix the resolution (don't worry its easy to do). Also if you want you can install some upscaled textures to make the game look a lot better.

The first problem I find is the lack of players online to play with.\n\nFor a game released in the same era as Unreal Tournament, Counter Strike or Donkey Kong 64, it looks visually good, with detailed characters and arenas.\n\nI truly love the sound effects, with iconic sounds that even appear in Counter Strike's servers.\n\nAnd here comes the second problem: price. Seriously, Bethesda? Do you really want us to pay 15\u20ac for a game that lacks of online players, repetitive arenas in singleplayer and being more than 20 years old? Not even on sales, dude. That 6\u20ac hurt to pay. Even Quake 1's remaster (the 2021 release) is cheaper and way more fun. The only reasonable way to buy this is with the Quake pack. Otherwise, don't buy it.\n\nI know old school players will argue with me for saying this, and I don't blame hem, since Quake 3 is historic for multiplayer games, but just like I said, it's history.

And there is no overlap in what each weapon does (for example UT that were released at the same time had really overpowered weapons with multiple modes of firing).\n\nThe walking speed is a bit odd since it's slower than both previous titles in the series but you gain speed much faster by strafe jumping so it does become faster than Quake 2 because of that. I remember from the early previews before the actual release that they attempted to limit the amount of jumps to no more than 2 jumps before a slight delay would occur. If they had shipped that then Quake 3 would have felt entirely different and much much slower and many kinds of map traversal used competitively during 1 on 1's would have been simply not possible (I'm so glad they didn't ship that).\n\nLike Quake 2 there's lack of air control but that can be compensated a lot by rocket jumping and strafe jumping much more so than Quake 2.\n\nIt's also odd how much easier the weapons are to aim an score a hit with in this title. I have a much harder time getting a hit with the Quake 2 railgun than the Quake 3 railgun.\n\nThe maps are great. I really have had a great time playing for hours and hours on most of these maps with friends.\n\nA hugely negative thing that are no longer relevant is the bug the game shipped with where the amount of frames per second decided how high you could go on the jump pads (certain very important jumps on Tourney 4 were only possible with high FPS). I'm certain they could easily have fixed that issue quite early on but it actually stayed for far too long. I do not remember any other competitive game before or since were you had to invest in a high performance PC in order to compete simply due to a physics bug.\n\nThe game also shipped with rockets and plasma being able to do damage when hitting below the floor of the player. That was actually quite awesome on Tourney 4 but I do understand why they removed it though. However then Tourney 4 became far too easy to dominate until they added the portal in the middle later on and moved the weapons around a bit.", "timestamp_created": 1662058046, "timestamp_updated": 1705611904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "156246726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986568434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1740073618}, "language": "english", "review": "its not the game its steam , steam is realy crap  recommend the game but wont be recommending  steam to anyone", "timestamp_created": 1705601897, "timestamp_updated": 1705601897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447761178016662598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "156194163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077717615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1740805827}, "language": "english", "review": "Old scool cool!", "timestamp_created": 1705527164, "timestamp_updated": 1705527164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "156071001", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965183877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1705471134}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic!", "timestamp_created": 1705368891, "timestamp_updated": 1705368891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "156002365", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995246701", "num_games_owned": 1332, "num_reviews": 867, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1705275760}, "language": "english", "review": "It's amazing how people still play this game in 2024.

Both are now 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand\u2014the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed\u2014the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.\n\nUpon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.\n\nWith nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.\n\nAfter realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.\n\nToday, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.\n\nNow I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1703846780, "timestamp_updated": 1703940098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429190695285797119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "154629498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040587033", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1729360379}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

The game heavily revolves around accuracy, strafing and strafe-jumping to outplay your opponent.\n\n[b]Review[/b]:\nI'm not entirely sure why id Software went and made three completely different Quake games, as none of the first three have all too much in common. Quake 1 was more Lovecraftian / Gothic style with a dark and medieval tone, Quake 2 went sci-fi with the Strogg and then there's Quake 3 which went full force with arena shooting and the only connection to the previous titles are some of the avatars. Nonetheless, each Quake is worth playing in my opinion and they serve as some of my best memories from childhood.\n\n[b]Game play[/b]:\nQ3 is all about speed, precision, accuracy, strafing, map knowledge and situational awareness. If you managed to successfully master all of the above, you were a force to be reckoned with up until you matched against someone who did it better than you.\n\nThis was one of the major flaws in arena shooters that ultimately led to its downfall player wise. The time and skill it took to be among the best was massive and one couldn't hope to jump into an arena with experienced players as your chances of survival was next to nothing, not to mention the lack of guides or even mentors to teach you how to play the game. Pawnage was the name of the game and if you couldn't keep up, well, you were pawned.\n\nThe game offers an awesome array of weapons meant for a variety of situations. The railgun does high damage, but it's slow and fairs poorly in close-quarters ([i]unless you're an expert at moving and precision[/i]), the rocket launcher is awesome for close-quarters, but rockets are slow, so timing is everything, then there's the plasma gun that has an outstanding rate of fire with high damage, but timing and maneuvering your projectiles perfectly can be a hassle against a moving target. All these little nuisances are what made this game loads of fun to play, but also incredibly difficult to master.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]:\nid Tech 3 for its time ([i]like most gaming engines for it's time, especially id Tech[/i] was quite revolutionary. Geo-metrics, optimization, lighting, you name it, it just nailed everything to give a smooth experience. It wasn't the prettiest of graphics and thinking of Q3 then versus now, it's everything but a pretty game, but then again, games like these don't need to be. I recently played Unreal Tournament 3 as well just for comparison and although the game is light years more beautiful, it also adds clutter that make it difficult to see the most important details during a match.\n\n[b]Story[/b]:\nThere's a campaign, but no story. The goal is to literally play through all of the campaign maps divided into tiers. Each tier has a boss that you face against and once beaten, you move to the next tier until tier 6 ([i]being the anomaly[/i], followed by the final boss being Xero ([i]don't even try to match him 1v1 in an honourable way. Find the cheapest tactic and just win against him[/i])\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]:\nIt's been years since I last played this game and the experience didn't last all too long, but I had a tremendous time replaying this. I miss those simpler days of gaming and thankfully I can re-experience glimpses of it with gems like these. If you do decide to pick this version up, I hope you have a great time. It's truly a masterpiece of a game.", "timestamp_created": 1694851918, "timestamp_updated": 1694851994, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437622487545013428", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "146299213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797904470", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1694722618}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.", "timestamp_created": 1694722350, "timestamp_updated": 1694722350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "146257683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969444370", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 784, "last_played": 1700096221}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just a good game to boot up and frag some bots", "timestamp_created": 1694658549, "timestamp_updated": 1694658549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557560205459594727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "77333483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081369886", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1128, "last_played": 1689496339}, "language": "english", "review": "good plot", "timestamp_created": 1602331075, "timestamp_updated": 1602331075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "77208590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881129165", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 777, "last_played": 1608912433}, "language": "english", "review": "Like it", "timestamp_created": 1602124484, "timestamp_updated": 1602124484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "76887475", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966338579", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 703, "last_played": 1736486893}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite simply the Gold Standard by which I measure the quality of the gameplay experience for all other games. The skillcap in this game is basically infinite, you can always improve.  It can be frustrating to play against people who are a lot better than you if you have the wrong idea of how to play the game and focus too much on only kills and winning.  Dealing damage in this game is satisfying in and of itself as there is a \"ping\" sound that plays when you score any hit.  When you play against better players, even just one kill is a big achievement, and taking satisfaction in your personal skill development and scoring hits is tantamount to enjoying the multiplayer experience.\n\nThere are several skill levels to choose from in single-player mode, and the bots are fun to play against for a long time.  They actually talk trash, and even compliment you when you outplay them!  \"There is no honor or glory in camping... except when I do it\" for example, is something a bot said to me after I had started camping.\n\nI can't recommend it highly enough.  It is 100% skill-based arena deathmatch.  In my opinion it is the pinnacle of that type of game, and its so fast-paced that I have to say I'd rate the gunplay higher than most new games.\n\nI don't know if Steam is the best place to get it.

The alternative being third-person perspective -- or TPP -- which, technically speaking, should include any game where you're looking at the character you're controlling from the outside, but which, in practice, is usually used to describe games with an over-the-shoulder \"follow cam\" (as opposed to \"isometric\", top-down, side-view, and probably others).\n\nThe FPS term wasn't widely used before release of Quake. Before that they were all called \"Doom Clones\" or FPP. Doom was actually the first game that brought recognition to the FPS genre as something distinct (even though there are games that fit FPS description and predate doom about 19 years, Id themselves released at least 3 FPS games before doom - Hovertank 3D, Catacomb 3-D and Wolfenstein 3D)\n\nSo if you want to be specific use FPS, if for example you want to talk about System Shock or Deus Ex use FPP as they're mix of FPS and RPG.

Arenas aren't fun anymore and weapons/characters here are way too vanilla to have fun messing around.\n\nQuake 3 Arena isn't really an expected sequel of Quake franchise. It actually throws off single-player portion fully and focuses on mutliplayer part, which was quite wise as of that time. Arena-styled Deathmatch was still hot and at the peak of interest, you see. It came out in 1999. It's notable that in same year Unreal pulled off same trick, coming out with Unreal Tournament.\nIt also had ports to Dreamcast and PS2. Dreamcast is awesome, supporting keyboard+mouse, 4-player split-screen, had online multiplayer and had new awesome music that PC doesn't have. PS2 version didn't had online part, but had improved single-player, with some story, from what I know. Didn't check out that one yet, but it has different final boss.\n\nAs you expect, it has usual technical problems nowdays.\nGame doesn't support widescreen by default. But you can look up Community Guide on Steam, one explains how to set it up easily.\nSteam Overlay is conflicting with this game as well. If you try to immeditly play at default setup, you will be horrified by all the graphical flickers and glitches. You have to go to game's system options and disable \"GL Extension\", after that it should be fine.\nThough, some computers will still experience crashes here and there. In this case you will have to disable whole Steam Community for this game. Bai bai overlay.\nI think that auto save from Team Arena expansion may erase Quake 3 Arena save. Goes both ways. So be careful with that one.\n\nAs for multiplayer community, it's somewhat alive. There are some servers with some players. Most often you will meet servers full of bots. Other times it will be pro players who will rip you apart.\n\nSo, what can I say. Q3 is a classic arena, where you spawn, you stock up, you encounter, you restock. Or respawn. While strafejumping and bunnyhopping like a chicken. Everybody starts the same, they spawn in random spot with no good weapons. After that you have to grab all the goodies on the map. Weapons, ammo, health, armor and powerups. Stocking and restocking is quite important, having more armor and health than opponent will put you into superior position. If you are good at shooting and maneuvering, that is. Health and armor over 100 slowly drop down, so you want to make use of it. You also want to be the first to grab the respawning powerup, which is announced by subtle sound. Pro players time it in mind. Remaining powerups drop from defeated players. \nAnd when it comes to duel, you should make sure that opponent will not get to timed powerups and big bonuses. It's called \"Arena Control\". It'a also wise to sometimes not to encounter the opponent.\n\nIt also has some physics exploits like bunnyhopping and harder to pull off strafejumping. Thankfully, bots don't use them.\n\nWeapons are designed to be balanced with each other and to be useful in each own situation. It's mostly a tried and classic combination weapon set, of rocket launchers, shotgungs, railguns and such, so people who wanted a gun that ricochets around walls and turns enemies into ice cream critized them heavily. They work really nicely though. Railgun requires at least two hits on a row for average opponent, which is always better than usual instakill of sniper rifles in other games. Shotgun is good even for medium distance and just gives off a nice hitscan punch. Rocket Launcher is universal, good for splash damage with huge direct hit damage. Good for rocketjumps too. Really, it's great to see that the game took more balanced weapon approach of Quake 2 and tried to combine it with faster pace of Quake 1.\n\nLevel design is great too, with nice astethic. It's either sci-fi base or more of gothic-hellish red style. Like Quake 1 style, but more careful and even more evil at times, it's great. Has enough verticality. Just nicely done, with all the curves and corners. It also has some interesting \"platforms in black space\" levels, though those are the worse bunch as far as balance goes. Too much open space, railfun users be happy. Gets even worse on the level which has many lift-platforms, making it all look quite messy. Otherwise, nice layouts with nice looks.\nSoundtrack is also nice too, being ambient-like at times and more actiony techno at others. Somewhat unique.\n\nIt has Free-For-All Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel and Capture the Flag modes. And bots are pretty bad at Capture the Flag for some reason. Expect to see them running with machine gun, failing to defend and failing to retrive the flag.\n\nNow, as far single-player, well, it's pretty much a bunch of bot matches with some progression. The in manual says that mysterious race Vadrigar teleported the greatest warrior of all time into arenas for their own amusement and they can't be fooled by Death, combatants just respawn. in the end you will beat current champion Xaero, who's spirits will leave the body and it will turn into statue. And errrr, I guess you will be still stuck in Arena. Yep, story is quite an excuse. You will not see any kind of story in game itself, just means that it has many different skins with no bio. Like Id All-Stars, including Doom, Grunt and Ranger. But hey, some skins are cool, check out huge eyeball on two hands.\n\nYou should play on Hardcore if you are a good player. Normal and lower ones handicap bots actually.\n\nAnd yea, it's just a bunch of Deathmatch matches with boss-like duel match for each Tier. In Deathmatch you will be hunting the weakest and spamming, in Duel you better be controlling spawn of bot's favourite weapon if you want to survive. Final boss really requires it, being Railgun auto-bot pro. This \"campaign\" will fly past quickly. Oh well, at least it has some feeling of progression, better than just leaving player with skirmish only.\nDid I tell you that bots actually have a bit of behavior personality and favourite weapons?\n\nAnd if you want to go online, then as said, it doesn't have as many players. More of bots. And it has really bad server browser that no one ever liked. Can't even categorize by amount of players.\n\nTo be honest, with Quake Live around, there is almost no reason to get Quake 3 for online, most of players went to Live. Quake 3 does have gibs, blood and it has Campaign of sorts, so maybe it's better for offliners who don't want to be beaten by pros.\nAnd yea, this is old game with classic DM rules. Most modern gamers will not dig it for long. No leveling or such, more duel-based than team-based. But at least it was nice at the time, even if didn't try to be as original as UT, instead giving players more of classic set.", "timestamp_created": 1439117205, "timestamp_updated": 1582824571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520505726337432861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "64084845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121755200", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1662856196}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was one of my two childhood staples (the other being Duke Nukem 3D) and one my first gaming experiences, and I will remember this game for the rest of my life.\nQuake III Arena arose from a new trend in the 1990's, a birth of sorts, of First Person Shooters. And just like with DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D, you can experience gaming at it's core with Quake III Arena. The main \"campaign\" (the story is practically non-existent) is a free-for-all gorefest of rockets, shotguns, and even guns that shoot raw beams of lightning. \n\nEvery level in the singleplayer campaign is a free-for-all deathmatch, which may be offputting to some, but there is a \"skirmish\" option with CtF, team deathmatch modes, etc. Every tileset and level are memorable and have their own charm to them, and the simple yet effective variety of guns, gadgets, and powerups are what makes this FPS classic so pure. Each weapon has its firm place with its pros and cons: from the sniper-like railgun that requires you to make your shots count, to plasma cannons unleashing a rapid, hazardous hellfire of heat so deadly you can damage yourself if you're not careful, to grenade launchers giving you the option of controlling chokepoints. Map-design is thought out and brings the best in each level.\n\nThe characters you are to quarrel with all have unique personalities, and by that mean they literally text messages to each other talking trash to you or others IN GAME, or cracking funny jokes. They can even respond to your own chat messages! So much flavour was put into this game and it shows so well; the maps you fight on themselves have just as much individual charm as the characters you face. Though the first sets of levels do look a little too similar to each other before you progress into stranger territory.\n\nQuake III Arena does have a multiplayer mode, with some active servers to this day. Besides that, it's pretty much it. If you're not satisfied yet, this game also has modding support with access to many custom maps made from gamers like you. And lastly, check out Quake III Team Arena as well for a change in style.

In the wake of heavily story-driven FPSes like Half-life, Unreal, and even Quake II, the successor of one of the biggest franchises moving to multiplayer-only was seismic. Despite the doom-saying and gnashing of teeth among series fans, Quake III proved to be an instant classic for online FPSes and helped establish the multiplayer-only genre as legitimate. But how does an online-focused classic fare nearly 20 years after the fact?\n\nI want to make fun of Quake III's story, but it's honestly about as much of one as Quake I has. Some bunch of space assholes called the Vadrigar have been grabbing badasses from across the universe to mash together in their own little lethal playhouse. This means you can play as the venerable Doom Guy, grunting wonder Ranger from Quake I, luckiest space marine ever Bitterman from Quake II, and a bunch of cooler dudes like a neon skeleton and an eyeball on legs. There's upwards of 30 characters to choose from, but honestly after Party Skeleton they seem kinda superfluous.\n\nThey're put to good use though in the game's campaign mode. See, there actually IS a single-player mode in Quake III, but it pits you against bots across seven tiers of simulated deathmatches. Starting you out one-on-one against slow-moving opponents in small arenas, the game soon expands to fragfests with half a dozen foes across industrial complexes and eldritch hallways floating in the void. As predictable as they can become, the bots provide a solid challenge at each of their five difficulties so it's actually not a bad place for newcomers to learn the art or veterans to practice their technique.\n\nThe weapons are simple enough to come to grips with as well. I don't know why the Quake series is so content to have incredibly generic arsenals, but it makes it easy to keep track of here. You start with a standard low-damage machine gun and can locate shotguns, rocket launchers, railguns, and plasma guns around the map, each with its own color-coded ammunition. There are health and armor pickups as well, along with a few stand-by powerups like quad damage. This pickup system, common in the Quake era, makes matches more about map control than anything else and can be a welcome change from modern loadouts and class systems.\n\nThis isn't going to matter a whole lot if you can't find actual humans to play with, of course. All the games of the Quake series still have fanatics playing them but they are just that, fanatics, which means they are limited in number and absurd in skill. It's not reasonable to expect newbie-friendly servers or anything other than pros to spar with so be prepared for that if you are diving into the scene solo. On the other hand, there are few things more sublime than some classic deathmatch with your closest buddies so if you have others you can take the plunge with this is an easy sell.\n\nBarring any graphical weirdness (which for me was remedied with disabling the Steam overlay) Quake III remains a very clean and polished experience, from the sharp if simple graphics to the tinny, growling announcer. Your weapons feel thick and threatening, the gibs gush freely, and the low electric growl of quad damage taking hold never gets old. Without a story-based singleplayer to work through this one does threaten to wear out its welcome. However, a little courage and effort diving into the online community that persists will reveal a world of wonders you might have thought died long ago.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Legitimately, no other game gets my reflexes, game-sense and accuracy as razor-sharp as this legendary title does. Here's why:\n\n[list][*]Blisteringly fast gameplay.\n[*]No reloading, just dakka-dakka.\n[*]Hilarious character designs and even funnier in-game taunts.\n[*]Buttery-smooth, stable frame-rate. With a maximum possible render speed of 200 frames per second, it's the silkiest 200 your gaming monitor could ever beam at you.\n[*]Comically overt gore, and satisfying gibs.\n[*]Demonic imagery and prentagrams, because why not? >:D\n[*]Highly satisfying hit-marker sound.\n[*]Mod-friendly, with MANY mods available internet-wide.\n[*]One of the most bad-ass announcers in gaming history.\n[*]Power-ups, including the infamous [b]QUAD DAMAGE[/b].\n[*]No friggin' levelling system, no loot boxes, no store, no in-game currency, only raw multiplayer.\n[*]Bones cratered.\n[*]Orbb.\n[*]Hossman.\n[*]Daemia.\n[*]Bitterman.\n[*]Grunt.\n[*]You have lost the lead.[/list]\n\nQuake 3 Arena is the sole reason I got gud at first-person-shooters. I first got a copy of the game in 2005. It would be many more years until I'd have internet with a ping under 700, so I'd play against the bots, and they most certainly aren't push-overs.\n\nAt the time I could barely compete against the medium difficulty bots. Just about a year later, I was already blazing through the nightmare bots without much hassle.\n\nThis game has a unique way of sharpening your senses and skills up, and quicker than almost any other game could. Quake 3's railgun is the reason I can flick-shot. The rocket launcher taught me how to predict an enemy's moves. The chain-gun and lightning-gun taught me how to keep my crosshair on a target, even while both of us are madly bouncing around the map. The gauntlet trains you how to side-wind to get a melee kill over a ranged enemy.\n\nNo jokes, if you wanna sharpen your skills up for the sake of any other game, whether it's CS:GO, Battlefield, Call of Duty or even Fortnite, this game will power-level your abilities like no other.\n\nThe only trouble you'll likely encounter is setting it up on a modern system. By default, the game only supports 4:3 resolutions, so if you're playing on a modern 16:9, or an ultra-wide panel, you'll have to set your preferred resolution, FOV and frame-rate in the game's configuration file. The way the game applies brightness to itself is also very strange, and for some reason, you can't easily alt-tab out of this game, but luckily this doesn't get in the way of fragging.\n\nIf you happen to own an old CRT monitor, plug that beast in and crank it up to 70hz for maximum nostalgia (and coil-whine).\n\n10/10, a timeless classic.\n\n[b]YOU HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1616590573, "timestamp_updated": 1617895632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863478660583496094", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "89887404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020235977", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2024, "last_played": 1676232797}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun old school 1st person shootem up - games like this is where it all started.", "timestamp_created": 1617804280, "timestamp_updated": 1617804280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "49602947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796795863", "num_games_owned": 625, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 594, "last_played": 1609056666}, "language": "english", "review": "The last title in the golden age of classic Quake games, Quake III was a childhood favourite of mine, alongside the previously released Quake II. The fast paced gameplay is perfectly complimented by the vast array of maps, each with their own unique differences in playstyle. For example, while some maps may have you duelling it out in long hallways and winding stairs with precision-reliant Lightning guns, others are completely open, with a sharp drop into nothingness on all sides; a one-shot railgun sits on a distant island. \n\nThere are a multitude of characters to choose from, but they are simply cosmetic. The only thing your character choice affects is your hitbox, with the smallest hitbox in the game belonging to a large eyeball on legs. \n\nThere is apparently meant to be a CTF gamemode, and possibly others, but I've only been able to set up free-for-all matches. Perhaps I'm just not looking hard enough, but I mainly play this game these days to relax and unwind after sweat sessions on my main game, Rainbow Six Siege. Sometimes absolutely fragging out is just what you need after being wallbanged 9 times in 9 rounds. \n\nThis is where I now address the difficulty settings, of which there are five: \n   I Can Win\n   Bring It On\n   Hurt me Plenty\n   Hardcore\n   Nightmare\nBut the only difficulty you need really have turned on is Nightmare, it's not as bad as it sounds. They only gave the AI aimbot, but not walls. \n\nIn short, this game is a classic of the FPS genre and one of its founders for what it has become today.

That may differ slight for Q3A though, only because of Quake Live.\n\nBack in 1999 and 2000 there were two arena shooters that ruled the genre: Unreal Tournament and Quake III Arena.\n\nNow my game was Unreal Tournament. I was hooked when I played the demo for hours from a PC gaming magazine. Back then it was worth it to buy a magazine for demos and games, let alone gaming information. From time to time, I've heard of Quake III Arena. I only knew it as a sequel to that shareware game I played years ago where I never got the full game because I was a broke child. \n\nFast forward to adulthood and I finally play it from a bargain bin collection pack and fire up Q3A LONG after it is relevant and has a playerbase after people reveled how great this game is. I fire it up and....This is it? A bunch of small maps with unimpressive weapons with wimpy sound effects in front of a forgettable soundtrack while playing against soulless bots with no voice acting but pretending to type clever quips when they frag or die? I was unimpressed to say the least and while I wasn't experienced enough to understand the nuances of the gameplay, I felt that Unreal Tournament could do everything Q3A did and better.\n\n[b]Little did I realize it was HUGE in the multiplayer and LAN world, which I never touched in the 56K days (I'm not even sure I could effectively do so, or even afford to do so). Fast forward even much further when Quake Live - a online free to play edition of Q3A integrated into Steam for a bigger player base. Now I understood. I joined some various servers, got handful of decent frags and proceeded to get my ass handed to me by rocket launchers and railguns. This is where twitch style PC arena shooting was truly originating and was king.\n\nGoing back to Q3A after running though the Quake series, I still feel abit of the same way - if I was stuck on a remote island and had to choose between playing only Unreal Tournament or Quake 3 Arena by myself - UT will win that vote hands down. But now I appreciate and respect Q3A and Q3A has a faster and smoother movement speed and feel that leads itself better to competitive play - which made it the more popular competitive shooter.[/b]\n\n[h1]Q3A is still a tad dull to play by yourself and the Single Player only truly provides map knowledge and target practice for the real meat of the game, which is multiplayer, which I'm not even sure you will find many servers for, as Quake Live was supposed to fix that problem. You may get lucky to find one or a few servers available at certain times, but this makes Q3A hard to recommend as a complete game experience. Instead, it is worth recommend due to being a playable grasp of what the classic game was back in its day and if you can manage to get a decent server here or in Quake Live, then you will feel the tight competitive nature of the game for real[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1550846363, "timestamp_updated": 1550846535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487488836050033569", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "49071168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087019527", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1328, "last_played": 1685380551}, "language": "english", "review": "THE BEST HARDCORE SHOOTER OF ALL TIME !! 10/10\nADVISE THIS GAME FOR ALL PLAYERS FROM 90's !", "timestamp_created": 1550490391, "timestamp_updated": 1550490391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "49061608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142816965", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 185, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1575662705}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a good game", "timestamp_created": 1550439656, "timestamp_updated": 1550439656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448678821325302124", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "49034730", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971057279", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1732391130}, "language": "english", "review": "What to say?

My favorite would have to be DooM guy\nAll the weapons are great my personal favorites would have to be the rocket launcher and the railgun getting a perfect shot with either of these weapons is super satisfying\nThis is one of those games you can load up anytime for some quick and fun action\nI love the anouncer voice it's super badass \nI like how the bots will leave friendly or salty mesages in the chat it helps make the experience feel more authentic\n\nCons\nSome of the Arenas kinda stink my least favorite would be the one in space with moving platforms going up and down all over the place\nThe 1v1 levels are either boring or way to intense I mean i know there suppost to be like boss battles but its just not that much fun to fight 1 guy in a small arena versus several in a big one\nIt's kinda annoying how if you kill yourself you lose a point now on paper there's nothing wrong with this but anytime you shoot someone into a pit you don't get a point it counts as suicide and this can be a little irritating in a few arenas\nAny time you get a new weapon the game will switch to it unless you turn the option off my problem with this is even when you already have all the weapons it still does this like if I just Railguned someone and run over a shotgun it'll swap and this can get irritating\nWhen selecting levels the option to click for the next selection is off screen to the right now you can still click it but it's a bit awkward\nMost the player models are pretty awesome from a design standpoint I have no problems with any of them but some are pretty big and bulky compared to the other ones so chooseing one of these may give you a disadvantage\nThe difficulty modes are kinda cheap on \"I can win\" the bots almost never attack you nad do very litle damage I'd reccomend this one if you just wanna unlock everything \"Hurt me plenty\" will give you the funnest challenge anything above that and the bots never miss and they might do extra damage on \"Nightmare\". My biggest problem with this is this is the first Id game that I can't beat on the higher diffficultys the best I can do is Hurt me plenty wich is basiclly Normal\n\nSo overall despite a fare few nitpicks I would definitly recommend this game as one of my personal favorites", "timestamp_created": 1546720904, "timestamp_updated": 1546721003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "48050101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802106456", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1609514558}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever.

You can easily fix this problem by unistalling the game and deleting every file on every partition you have that has quake3 in the name.\n\nI recommend this game. 7/10 would humiliate a player again!", "timestamp_created": 1546104306, "timestamp_updated": 1546384380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598177552223205566", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "47997947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970669200", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1539887438}, "language": "english", "review": "Best shooter ever created?

If you can get past not being able to *FULLY* change the resolution (stuck on 800 or 1000p)\"\n MAYBE THATS JUST A PROBLEM I HAVE I AM NOT SURE D:\n- Trust me your eyes will adjust to it in like 4 mins if you cant change the resulution.\nAs far as gameplay goes, its great. Its smooth, and everything you do makes you feel like you meant to do it, when you fall off the map, you feel it was your fault, not the games fault. The movement speed is great for moving around the maps but not too fast that makes you unhittable to players.\nThe sound isn't the best, it has dated BUT it works, I dont mind it. I would advise learning the sounds of pickups, gunshots and footsteps. (trust me it will help you in the long run) knowing what guns and pickups your opponents will heavily influence the  choices you make to either tail behind them and corner them, go to another side of the map and cut them off or if you can hear them picking up quite a few items you may want to stay away and pick up some weapons and armour yourself if you are in short supply.\nThere may be a bit of a learning curve if you are used to playing more modern games or if you are new to PC. BUT IF YOU ARE NEW TO PC *DONT* FORGET TO PLAY THE CLASSICS.\nFinal messages:\nDont let the graphics put you off.\nMultiplayer population is on the lower side but there is singleplayer with bots which works just fine (the bots are in some cases more toxic than the players xDD)\nThat summarizes my review for Quake III Arena.

After my first experience playing Quake II, which you can check that review for the experience, I had no idea what to expect from Quake III except greatness. It could have been a new single player, an enhanced multiplayer, really anything. But the word Arena was the next word I saw on the disk. I was a pretty smart kid, so I knew it was going to have a badass multiplayer. Little did I know that it was going to be ALL multiplayer.\n\nSo I booted up the game after installing it and started watching the intro. It showed some guy shooting down things and running out of ammo. The guy runs away and then decides to rush in. Immediately, I was a little unimpressed. After the Quake II intro, I was expecting awesomeness! Now it was just showing a cliche FPS sequence. Then, after diving towards the enemies, something unexpected happens. Time freezes as the guy is being teleported to some unknown place. This is where id Software did NOT disappoint! After being teleported, it then shows some gameplay of what I was going to be playing with random letters zooming out. I watched the gameplay and knew it had to be awesome. Then, the legendary words filled the CRT monitor.\n\n[b]QUAKE III ARENA[/b]\n\nI was hyped. I could not wait. So I went to the options to peek around and noticed there was a better Player Setup screen than Quake II. You could actually see who you were choosing before you picked them. MUCH better than having to scroll through the different models in Quake II to pick your character. And yes. Before you ask, the same customization of Quake II with being able to play as many different characters is avaliable here too. After picking this weird alien thing named Flisk, I immediately went into the game.\n\nThe graphics looked really nice. I was gazing upon the room I was in and noticed all the little details in the room. My eyes were like a kid in a candy store. The textures popped out like flowers in a field. The graphical detail was legend, and everything just seemed amazing. Then I noticed the mirror in the room. I gazed at my reflection and loved the little details on my character.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was the sudden announcer coming through my speakers. \"WELCOME TO QUAKE III ARENA!!\" I had never heard such a thing in a video game before. It was really mindblowing at the time. I then decided to test fire the guns I had collected. The machinegun sounded like a more powerful version of the one from Quake II, and the Shotgun sounded like it was the most devastating thing in the game. I decided to go outside the room and see what was going on around the map.\n\nI immediately ran into Crash, the first enemy opponent in the game. She's like Doomguy except she's a girl. I shot her down with my shotgun and noticed that she talked to me in text like she was a friend in real life. Wow! Talk about advanced! I never had a character talk to me in text like that. It was something really special at the time and it's something games just don't do anymore. It's kinda sad, but I can see why.\n\nAlright so the gameplay. Well, it's a shooter that is a heavily polished version of Quake II's multiplayer. Even the single player is just a bunch of fights with bots. Nothing really special, but it's good practice. The weapon balancing is something id wanted to do in this game and it really works well. Each weapon has its own use, just like the single player in Quake and Quake II. The Rocket Launcher is good for if your enemy is mid range, while guns like the Lightning Gun and Machinegun are great for long range attacks. The Shotgun is definitely used best at shorter ranges because of the more realistic spread this time around.\n\nThe gunplay isn't the only thing you'll want to learn in Quake III. Movement is definitely a really important skill to learn, especially if you plan on playing online. Since the original Quake engine had some bugs that made advanced moving techniques that are real useful in multiplayer possible, they decided to embrace those bugs and make them part of the physics of the game. Things like Bunnyhopping, circle jumping, and the infamous Rocket Jump are just a few examples of techniques that made Quake III very famous.\n\nOverall, I gotta say that Quake III Arena is to FPS games as Super Smash Bros. Melee is to fighting games. The really complex formulas and techniques that were present in the original Quake are improved and embraced in every way imaginable and the multiplayer community is still really strong. There was even a Dreamcast port of Quake III designed with Keyboard & Mouse controls in mind due to these special techniques that also has cross-platform capabilities with the PC version! Definitely get this game and enter the Arena!", "timestamp_created": 1450730898, "timestamp_updated": 1450731248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641681015491485596", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "19574457", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986154565", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1660584197}, "language": "english", "review": "hell yeah", "timestamp_created": 1449618371, "timestamp_updated": 1449618371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488826781511306763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "19358505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007871617", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1693880529}, "language": "english", "review": "Arena shooters offer some of the best 1v1 competitive games of skill and strategy.

Where do i start on this game? Although it appears that I have low play time on this game I actually played a hell of a lot of this game before I was on steam. This game is nuts, but you know..... fun nuts. The maps in this game are fun with not too many camping spots (as if you would feel the need to anyway) and are mostly quite large. \n\nNow....... The guns. Ok, so first up is the Machine Gun which is only good if you are accurate and your enemy is very inaccurate so lets skip this one. Then there is the Shotgun. One hit kill at short range of course and good damage at medium range. The Rocket Launcher is deadly to both your enemy and yourself but can also tend to take a few hits to kills if not hit directly. The Plasma Gun is basically a super Machine Gun. It has a lot more damage and similar fire rate. the Grenade Launcher in my opinion is the hardest gun to use because you have to time as well as place the grenade well. the Railgun, my favourite weapon, is basically a sniper that you have to no scope with (except unlike no scoper's in COD it actually takes skill) and is either a one or two hit kill. The Lightning Gun shoots out a stream of lightning towards your enemy and does decent damage. It's kind of like a Super Soaker except instead of water coming out there's lightning. And finally there is the BFG10K. now this gun is a one hit kill and has a fast automatic fire rate so it kicks arse. \n\nNow in addition to these guns is the gauntlet, which is basically a glove with a spinning saw blade on it. Its usually a two or three hit kill but its always fun to kill someone with it. also there are several other items that can be placed on the maps such as +5, +25 and +50 health capsules, +5 armour shards, +50 and +100 armour vests, a mega health capsule, a quad damage power-up, as well as a regeneration power-up and a beast power-up.

I grew up on the Unreal side and so I'm a little biased towards that series, but I still love the Quake series and this game is still amazing in comparison to UT99 and all on its own. A crowning\nachievement for arena FPS, multiplayer FPS and for iD.\n\n[b]The Great:[/b]\n++Totally skill-based deathmatch galore. Git gud, or git rekt. Balanced, competitive gameplay but easily accessible to casuals.\n++Weapons deliver power and will destroy opponents when used right. Great arsenal and impactful feel.\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+Gore is great\n+The amount of characters from iD games over the years is awesome\n+Sound design is decent\n+Brilliant graphics with impressive texture work and animations\n+Runs very well on modern systems without any tweaking necessary (unless you want HD resolutions and higher FOV, of course)\n+Awesome music\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]\n+-N/A\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-The AI is just aim-botty on the hardest difficulty\n-Maps aren't too visually diverse, even if the artstyle is good\n-Too light on gameplay customisation\n-Short campaign\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--An expensive add-on (Quake III: Team Arena) was released to add maps and game modes that absolutely should have been there from the beginning\n\nSound: 9/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nContent/Replayability: 5/10 (without a community)\nOverall: 9/10\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThere's no reason to compare UT99 against this.

It\u2019s a steal when on sale for 75% off but the collection is normally only $25 and totally worth the asking price in my opinion. I didn\u2019t want to review all 3 games and their expansion pack material separately, so I figured I\u2019d simply do a review for QUAKE III and do a brief breakdown for all titles.\n\nQUAKE: It\u2019s dark and creepy atmosphere takes a page from Lovecraftian lore and though its dated appearance and overly dark lighting (for some reason you can\u2019t seem to adjust the brightness at all, or at least I couldn\u2019t) may turn some off from playing this game, it still has a lot to offer whether you\u2019re a fan simply looking for a little bit of nostalgia from a beloved shooter series or a gamer merely looking to partake of some classic gaming and you\u2019ve heard the word \u2018QUAKE\u2019 thrown around for a number of years and figured it was about time you got around to checking it out. This game singlehandedly gave birth to speedrunning and rocket jumping in FPS games. Even if you don\u2019t want to give it a spin, or its 2 mission expansion packs (both just as good as the core game and they still maintain the Lovecraftian element but with some Egyptian elements as well), at least check out all of the crazy \u2018QUAKE done quick\u2019/\u2019QUAKE done quickest\u2019 videos and I think you\u2019ll agree that you can at least appreciate what QUAKE did for the FPS genre, if not the game itself.\n\nQUAKE II: A change in both tone and style (no more Lovecraft, total sci-fi setting now), this game will likely be much more enjoyable to play than its predecessor for most people. It is graphically much more impressive and the particle effects are real!! Seriously, they look great and the lighting in the environments is much better than the doom/gloom of QUAKE. Even without the inclusion of Lovecraftian lore/enemies, there are still some disturbing biomechanical abominations to go along with the sci-fi setting, so that\u2019s a good thing. Also, just like with QUAKE, there was sadly no music, at least for me, but the sound effects are good and it\u2019s still fun to play. Oh yeah, you can now look around with your mouse. Sure, that\u2019s nothing new per se but when coming from QUAKE and going directly into QUAKE II that\u2019s going to feel new and revolutionary all over again. Both expansion packs are just as good as the core game and combined, they at least rival its length if not surpass it.\n\nQUAKE III: Totally awesome! It\u2019s basically just Unreal Tournament Quake style w/ a crazy mix of characters/boss characters (essentially just regular characters but tougher) running around at a super high framerate, each trying to out-kill the next guy. This game makes me wish I would have been into the whole multiplayer deathmatch thing back when it first came out, but it also makes me glad that we now have QUAKE: Champions and there is still supposedly a reboot coming our way that would pull mostly from QUAKE and its Lovecraftian themes.

developed by id Software and released in 1999.\n\nThis third episode abandons the linear story mode of the two previous games,\npreferring to focus brilliantly on arena combat and multiplayer.\nThis is one of the last great iconic FPS games of the 90s,\nand one of the most cult Arena Shooters ever released.\n\nThis episode does not offer a single player campaign strictly speaking,\nbut a series of levels in which you fight to the death for your survival,\nagainst opponents without mercy, in arenas full of weapons, \njump pads, and power-ups of all kinds.\nSharpen your reflexes and prepare for wild gunfights,\nagainst battle-hardened and ferocious bots.\n\nQ3A's gameplay is hectic, intense, and brutal.\nBots are fast, responsive and skillful,\ngiving rise to fierce battles,\nleaving you almost no second of respite,\nas long as you play on a high difficulty (like Hardcore),\ngiving all its flavor to the game.\n\nA large choice of levels is available,\nall more lugubrious and demonic than the others,\ncomprising oppressive steel corridors littered with skulls and flaming torches, \ndried blood, lava and rust, all topped by infernal skies.\n\nMost of the maps have an unforgettable level design and style,\nhere is an anthology of my favorites, each having an infamous name:\n\"Arena Gate\", \"The Places of Many Deaths\", \"The Campgrounds\",\n\"Brimstone Abbey\", \"Hell's Gate\"...\n\nAny cult FPS must have weapons worthy of the name,\nand Quake III can boast of having 9 of the most effective weapons in the entire FPS genre,\namong which the most important are described below.\n\nThe Double Barrel Shotgun has phenomenal power at close range,\nand will annihilate anyone within close range.\nThe Rocket Launcher is very powerful and accurate, and kills in one or two hits,\nit is also practical for doing Rocket Jumps and reaching high surfaces.\nThe Railgun is a laser cannon with perfect precision, and kills in two shots except headshot,\nit can act as a sniper rifle for fans of ranged combat.\nThe Machine Gun and Plasma Gun are the two submachine guns in the game,\nthe first being available from spawn, and the second being much more powerful.\nThe Lightning Gun fires electricity continuously, and although its power seems limited,\nits very high rate of fire makes it a weapon not to be underestimated.\n\nSeveral items to collect spice up the games,\nwhile others just allow you to survive longer in this chaos.\n\nIn addition to health and armor points, but also weapons and ammunition,\nseveral powerups are available,\ngranting superb time-limited benefits to the player who picks them up.\n\n\"Haste\" increases your character's speed and weapon rate of fire by 30%.\n\"Quad Damage\" multiplies your weapon damage by 3, and no, that's not a typo...\n\"Regeneration\" heals you little by little for 30 seconds, up to a maximum of 200HP.\n\"Invisibility\" makes you transparent for 30 seconds, useful for surprising your opponents.\n\"Personal Teleporter\" is an activatable item, which teleports you to a random respawn point.\n\"Personal Medkit\" is also an activatable item, and instantly restores your health up to 125HP. \n\nThe different characters have an inimitable design,\nand have for the most part become icons of the \"Boomer Shooter\" as they say nowadays.\nHere are some of the game's most famous fighters:\nRanger is the main character of the first Quake, who needs no introduction.\nBitterman is the hero we play in Quake II, what more can be said?\nDoom is better known as Doomguy, and represents id Software's cult franchise.\nAnarki is the only character to have a multi-colored name, he is also recognizable thanks to his hoverboard,\nOrbb is a huge eyeball with a small mechanical body and vaguely human legs.\nKlesk is a sort of orange alien with a demonic appearance.\nSarge, like the previous character, reminds me so much of the PS2 version called \"Quake III Revolution\", which I had so much fun playing with at the time.\n\nThe soundscape is as undoubtedly successful as everything else.\nThe Q3A OST is one of my favorites in all games, that\u2019s saying something!\nSonic Mayhem and Front Line Assembly made a masterpiece of Industrial Metal, very hardcore and heavy,\nwhich will delight all music-loving metalheads of which I am a part,\nand highlighting all the power and brutality of this sublime game.\n\nLet's not forget the hoarse voice of the Announcer, and his famous \"Excellent\" when we do two frags in two seconds, or \"Impressive\" when you hit two enemies in a row without missing with the Railgun.\n\nHow to write an objective review of such an FPS monument?\nIt's a difficult exercise as Quake III represents the quintessence of the FPS,\nand the excellent Arena Shooter genre which is now defunct.\nQ3A symbolizes excellence in all areas:\nfast, brutal, gory, enjoyable, beautiful and gripping,\nid Software's game is simply masterful,\nand is essential for anyone who claims to be a gamer and FPS fan.\nLong live Quake III Arena !", "timestamp_created": 1711254263, "timestamp_updated": 1722307548,

this game (specially when the sale is active), so much nostalgic memories like back in the days as being a very young teen taking a version of Quake 3 on a flashdrive to school and all of a sudden the whole class is playing a multiplayer lan party against eachother. and teacher even didnt gave a damn about it. the only thing he asked was why i went to every pc with my flashdrive, those are some nice memories of the teenhood. the game is already over 20 years old and it still runs amazing on modern systems as Windows 10 no need to have to use dangerous 3rd party programs to make it running,

Q3DM17 became my stomping ground, where I'd spend hours honing my skills and taking down bots with ruthless efficiency.\n\nHowever, as much as I enjoyed the game, my enthusiasm began to wane when I realized that none of my friends shared my passion for it. The lack of companionship in multiplayer matches left me feeling isolated, and gradually, I found myself drifting away from Q3A. It became increasingly difficult to justify spending time on a game that I couldn't share with others.\n\nThat being said, my fondness for Quake III Arena remains undiminished.

Blink, and you'll miss it \u2013 that's the motto of Quake III, where speed isn't just a luxury; it's a way of life.\n\nNow, let's talk about movement. You see, in Quake III, we don't just walk; we dance. It's like the devs looked at gravity and said, \"Nah, we can do better.\" Bunny hopping, strafe jumping \u2013 it's all about defying the laws of physics with style. And let me tell you, there's nothing quite like the feeling of nailing a perfect circle strafe around some poor sap who thought they had you cornered.\n\nAs for the maps, they're a thing of beauty. Each one is a playground of chaos, filled with hiding spots, ambush points, and plenty of opportunities for creative fragging. It's like a twisted game of hide-and-seek, where the seeker has a rocket launcher and the hiders have a death wish.\n\nAnd then there's instagib. It's like playing tag with lasers, except instead of tagging someone, you're obliterating them into a cloud of pixelated dust. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of vaporizing your opponents before they even know what hit them.\n\nQuake III Arena isn't just a game; it's a legend. It's the kind of game that leaves its mark on you \u2013 both figuratively and literally, if you count all the frags you rack up. Without Quake III, the world of competitive shooters just wouldn't be the same. So grab your weapons, strap on your rocket-powered rollerblades, and get ready to frag like there's no tomorrow.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros:\n- Insanely fast-paced gameplay.\n- Movement mechanics.\n- Maps that are as clever as they are deadly.\n- Instagib mode \u2013 because who doesn\u2019t love a good vaporization?\n- A classic that's influenced generations of gamers and game developers alike.\n\nCons:\n- You might find yourself dreaming of rocket jumps and circle strafes.\n- Makes other shooters feel like they're stuck in slow motion.\n", "timestamp_created": 1716363312, "timestamp_updated": 1716363312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "165402536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329337504", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1721890887}, "language": "english", "review": "Igazi klasszikus shooter, sz\u00e1momra a mai napig elfogadhat\u00f3 grafik\u00e1val!

From the era of CRT monitors, dial-up internet, beige PC cases, ball mice and internet cafes to the current era of RGB, mechanical keyboards, high speed Wi-Fi and 4K screens, this game kicks ass like it always has and always will. And damn would you look at all these character skins, betcha they'd charge you plenty of money for these nowadays.\n\nYes, the polygon count on the models barely makes it to double digits and the whole game has the colour palette of dried vomit. And yes, it will take some tinkering, some console commands or maybe even a mod or two to make this run with modern settings. But with that out of the way, this game still runs like a dream and feels awesome. Quake III still has the best controls of any shooter I have ever played, bar none. I don't care that this game is over 20 years old now, no other game has ever managed to even match it. Everything is so responsive, it's as if it's reading your mind. The guns are superbly precise and controllable, all the variables are in your hands. \n\nThe skill ceiling is unimaginably high and no matter how good you are, there is always someone better, there is always more to improve upon. It's a testament of mechanical skill, reflexes and tactics, distilled to it's purest form. Back when I was a snot-nosed brat, I sucked way too much at games to properly enjoy this, but now I have grown, I have changed and I am ready to tackle this old demon again. And wrestling with its challenges is as fun as ever. \n\nTL:DR Every gamer needs to play this game and pay it it's due respects. This is where boys became men. This is where legends were forged. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going back into the Arena to get some frags while sipping on my white Monster. Times have changed but this game is just as it always was, and that's a good thing.

Tight controls one expects from a PC fps are definetly put to use here, and if you wanted an example of PC over console, this is it. Story wise, this game is weeeaaak. It isnt told at all, and has unexplained cutscenes. You have to read the manual or look it up online to get what's going on, and I'm not going to tell you, as I feel it isnt to prominent in the game or this review. So that leaves the gameplay to decide how good of a game this is. the gameplay, is, amazing. As I said the controls are wonderful, and everything just works. Jumping to frag a guy and doing a 180 to frag another WHILE going dowhill onto another platform only to be propelled to a weapon of mass destruction is a great example of great gameplay, and fantastic level design. I would like to see how this game fairs on a console (Dreamcast version is all I know about unfortunately) but I cant imagine it being as good as the PC version. The soundtrack is a great metal and rock mix, full of the ambient sounds of screaming in some arenas gives off a darker mood, while the use of the metal can pump you up and ready you to blow up everyone in others. As far as characters go like I said the story is basically nill, but each has its own personality and little sayings in combat. Weapons in the game are designed well and all of them are fun to use, though it does seem a bit tedious stalking enemies with the machine gun you get right off the bat. Also, it is nice to see the BFG make an appearance.\n\nMy score: 8/10\n\nThough the story is weak, I rated Half-Life a 8 or 9 and that had mediocre gameplay, so its alright.

Anyway, when I first heard of Quake III, I didn't quite know what I should expect. I just read about the premise that the game was developed to be focused on the multiplayer experience. The irony was that although this title had exactly that concept in mind, that was the only one that I never had the chance to play with other people. Hmm what is there to say? For me it felt like a polished version of Quake II's multiplayer and later it wasn't hard to compare it with Unreal Tournament (which I won't deny that I liked better). Besides that, back then there were some really interesting mods involving the game's engine, like for example \"Bid for Power\", which had some DBZ characters and levels to play on.

A pure deathmatch game at it's best. The controls are perfect, the vanilla graphics are still good today, and the gameplay... fucking awesome! One of my favorite features is the ability to play against bots with friends. Very fun if you just want to co-op in the game.\n\nI will say one thing. This game will test your skills and even help you improve your aim and reaction time as the combat is fast and fierce. After playing this game, I can say I am better at FPS games, especially ones with rocket launchers ;). This is one thing I cannot say you will get from most FPS games. This gives it another reason why this game kicks so much a$$! Not only are you having fun, but you are excersising your hand-to-eye coordination.\n\n[h1]Easy To Mod[/h1]\n\nThis game is also very easy to mod. All you need to do is open the .pk3 files in a program like WinZip or WinRar and you can replace the game's sound effects, graphics, and models with custom ones you either downloaded or made yourself.\n\nTalking about mods, I highly recommend downloading ioQuake3 ( http://ioquake3.org ). It replaces Quake 3's rendering engine to suit modern machines giving you better net code and the ability to match your computer's native resolution. You can also download other mods for ioQuake3 to improve the game. Some other mods I recommend is the high res texture pack ( http://ioquake3.org/extras/replacement_content ) and the Metal-Tech v2.0 mod that replaces the textures for the weapons with higher res ones ( http://www.moddb.com/mods/metal-tech-v20-revolutions ).\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nOn final note, this game is pure awesomeness and has a high replay value.

On the other, I think Unreal Tournament did a heck of a lot better than Quake 3 in many respects.\n\nThe game is fairly straightforward, fix the issues for modern computer (or use source ports) go to the options, pick your player model (I favor DOOM), set your name and have at it. The main arena mode is fairly enjoyable, the bots can be quite challenging on all difficulties save for one (I'll let you figure out which one) and while I'm not too fond of the maps themselves, they can be a blast to run around on.\n\nI love any game with a skirmish or instant action mode. Set the bots you want, pick a map and go. It's good stuff.\n\nNow, in terms of map design, variety, presentation and the way the bots interact with the player and taunt each other, I think Unreal Tournament is better by leaps and bounds. While I'm sure Quake 3's map design is catered toward rocket jumps and frantic shooter action, I quite prefer the variety in maps and aesthetics UT offered over the red skies and full textures of the Arena Eternal.\n\nQuake 3's menus are dull and boring. Just red text, a sniper's cross hair and flaming words that scream Quake III Arena on a black backdrop. The menu's feel so rushed and unfinished it's honestly disappointing, it has no identity, it's like a fan game. I honestly think UT wins in terms of presentation to be honest.\n\nBot dialogue goes away so fast and there's no way (that I can find) to view past chat messages in game which sucks. Bot interaction with the player is such a cool concept.\n\nI haven't tried the multiplayer, mostly because Oceania has such cruddy ping and I don't want to have to deal with players who are so good at the game that their ego makes up their entire gaming personality.\n\nNow, as far as recommending the game goes: [b]YES![/b] I honestly would recommend this game over Quake Live just because of the bots and how much more simplistic it is. If you can troubleshoot some of the known issues players encounter (I never did) you'll have a blast. There's still a multiplayer community so if that tickles your fancy you might enjoy Quake III Arena.\n\n[b]NOTE:[/b] A consistent issue I've found with Q3A is that when launched the game will run but no window show's up and the game will continue to count hours. No other games can be played nor steam shut down forcing me to restart my computer. I found out that this can be remedied by opening the task manager, finding the Quake 3 exe process under processes and ending it. Relaunch the game and BAM, good to go.\n\nHowever, this is not a full proof solution and sometimes Steam doesn't realize that the game has been shut down.", "timestamp_created": 1564577037, "timestamp_updated": 1567252356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491068035364151001", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "54775219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118269449", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 132, "last_played": 1561535280}, "language": "english", "review": "nice Quake Live downgrade", "timestamp_created": 1566619318, "timestamp_updated": 1566619318, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.158516064286231995", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "54730425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118160557", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1741706973}, "language": "english", "review": "The physics are great.", "timestamp_created": 1566380365, "timestamp_updated": 1566380365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "54676050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264396612", "num_games_owned": 923, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1566108527}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605", "timestamp_created": 1566108562, "timestamp_updated": 1566108562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "49695292", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997763461", "num_games_owned": 954, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 195366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195366, "last_played": 1554453847}, "language": "english", "review": "I think I finished the tutorial, still testing, looks good.", "timestamp_created": 1553264722, "timestamp_updated": 1565684191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "54592059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138879013", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3083, "last_played": 1639629320}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so fun!

While a compelling game for many multiplayer fans at the time, I was barely a fetus when this title came out and thus \"just\" missed the mark of playing it myself with my own barely developed hands. Thus, here I am now critiquing a game from my birth year trying my best to combine my understanding of its value to the industry with my delayed experience of playing it myself. This will be fun...\n\nI mostly focused on the singleplayer aspect of this game since there are very few legitimate servers still in existence, and every time I tried to join one of those they would be empty or full of AFK players. Thus, my experience was with the solo arena mode...and it wasn't half bad! Granted the concept of fighting AI opponents in a random stage got a bit repetitive, but each stage was unique and provided a lot of action to get accustomed with the mechanics in this title.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty much the same as other Quake games. Here, you will pick up weapons from specific spots around each map as well as ammo from similar spots. There are some upgrades around the map as well that can make your character deal more damage or run faster, and there aren't too many that complicate the game flow or mechanics too much.\n\nEnemies are pretty stupid at the \"normal\" setting (forgot the name but it was the perceived middle difficulty). They'll be entertaining and run around the map fighting you or each other, and are capable of getting some kills (mostly not on you though). Maps are designed with enough verticality and size to allow for some breathing room between fights, and the textures are about the same as Quake II's.\n\nHowever, I didn't really get to experience the game's multiplayer, which is what the game was designed around. The singleplayer version of it was alright, but there weren't enough servers in my tie zone to get into games consistently, and honestly playing it this far down the line it would be lacking the original feel anyway. Therefore, I can't review the game based off of that component.\n\nIt is still a weird thing to me that ID Software decided to create a multiplayer focused Quake so early on in the IP's lifetime. While it definitely increased the game's popularity in the short-run, in the long-run it stifled the game's potential for solid singleplayer adventures like in the first two titles. I'm aware that Quake IV was somewhat of a return to form, but the lack of future sequels afterwards proved that the original formula lost its audience in ID Software's eyes.\n\nOverall, this is a game that I can [b] Recommend [/b] despite difficulties in actually experiencing its multiplayer components. It has a cheesy, basic, but fun solo arena mode, and the mechanics are solid, yet familiar enough to get some enjoyment out of. Try this one out if you enjoyed the first two and would like an arena style version to mess around in, but don't be surprised if there is a lack of content in that same regard.

As a result, every multiplayer FPS arena shooter that came after owes it's legacy to this game. It defined a number of conventions of the genre that still hold to this day in other similar games.\n\nUnlike iD's previous Quake installments, this game has no singleplayer campaign in the traditional sense. The campaign is rather just a series of arena deathmatches with increasing numbers of bots of varying intelligence over different maps. If you can clear all the matches, you win.\n\nSadly online multiplayer is mostly dead, but playing single player is still a challenge because the bot intelligence can be set really high. It will test your FPS skills out and make you a better player, guaranteed.\n\nIt's a classic in every sense of the word and still holds it's own today. It will even run on potato computers and look great doing so.", "timestamp_created": 1651151831, "timestamp_updated": 1651152121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716847658157348633", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "16327662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100299403", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 645, "last_played": 1706822329}, "language": "english", "review": "s'good", "timestamp_created": 1434111815, "timestamp_updated": 1650981456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "114348359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027946344", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1704542235}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.", "timestamp_created": 1650733363, "timestamp_updated": 1650733363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}, {"recommendationid": "114255375", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984922261", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 655, "last_played": 1738380995}, "language": "english", "review": "You like to gib bots and laugh at the sounds?

The atmosphere was moody, the game was dark and intimidating, but at the core of it, as a player, it never feels like the game is against you or punishing you, it is FAIR, brutally so, there is no \"escape\" button to save you, the character designs are kinda wacky, the bot DM maps and bosses ease you in - starting from Q3DM0 the first map against Crash, a very small hallway with only one or two weapons and two opposing spawn points - this is amazing game design - teaching you everything you need to know to get started before throwing you into a deathmatch with multiple bots.\n\nAs a kid I gained my skills in those offline deathmatches, and I went online and got blasted, I sat in awe of the skill that some players seemed to have, instead of being discouraged I wanted to live in the world they did - where they were able to put the game on and dominate. So many iconic memories of playing on maps like The Longest Yard - a map where you have access to a railgun, multiple opponents, and almost zero hiding spots and cover, if you had good aim (most people were using rollerball mice pre 2006!) you'd be able to pick players off while hearing that reassuring \"IMPRESSIVE, EXCELLENT\" driving the dopamine home, iconic.\n\nID were a bunch of guys who were having fun making the games they thought were great, they had no business blueprint to achieving annual ROI, they had no formula to follow, they operated in a free creative arena and as a result created one of the most fun and balanced competitive arena shooters of all time, dare I say the best, still, because in my eyes, yes it is dated but which modern title can I say is crafted better, overall?\n\nThanks for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1727276562, "timestamp_updated": 1727276562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689906895160675049", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}]
