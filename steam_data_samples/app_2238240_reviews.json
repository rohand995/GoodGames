      "review": "At the time of this writing, this review is based only on solo play and it is primarily based on the first two sections of the primary level (Level 0).\n\nAt around three hours in, I'm going to give this a hesitant 'Yes' vote. If it were not in Early Access, I'd say No, but as it is new, in Early/Alpha Access, a small team, and is being regularly worked on; I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. I will, however, play it much more to establish that my initial opinion holds.\n\nFor the positives: I truly appreciate the lack of a motion-blur! The controls are fluid and mostly intuitive. So far there has been no voice acting, but the sound effects are solid. The graphics are quite nice, and this game has one of the best presentations and uses of the smiling entity in any of the Backrooms games that I've played (and I own around 15 or so at this point). The death animations are the best out there, and the remaining bloodstains are a good addition. The found-footage/VHS effect is well done and unintrusive, which is a nice change for many of these games. The black puddle triggers were a pleasant surprise as is the suit-color choice; you don't see much customization in Backrooms games. The Dev is responsive to the community and is very hands on.\n\nA neutral point: so far, there have been no puzzles.\n\nThe negatives: if you're going to have solo-play, get a decent fu*cking save system implemented for gamer's with lives outside of gaming. That's my usual rant :)\n\nThe map isn't very randomized, nor does it seem, are the resource locations. This allows for map-memorization, which lessens replay value and takes away from some of the immersion and sense of dread. Backrooms games are, per cannon, about confused wandering and lonely isolation with looming and ever-present dread. I can see where this lack of randomization is a positive to some, but it is a negative for me (at least a randomization of resources and exit-doors would change the 'feel' for me). This is, however, addressed in the Dungeon Crawler mode. It has a different mode of game-play, but it has procedure-generated levels.\n\nYou can run endlessly, but if you pause while being chased, you cannot pick up speed once more. You also drop to a crawl at first injury. Once spotted, you cannot escape the entity and they're so difficult to get around in the second phase of Level 0, that I'll go so far as to call it unbalanced (and this is being worked on, so I doubt that it will remain an issue).\n\nLastly, and this is a minor technical glitch that will likely be adjusted in future fixes, but on many walls and the Level 0 first door, if you stand up against it, you can see through it, and once I got stuck in a wall and could not get out. Sudden head-turns in level 1-2 break up the animation a bit. Those are, however, the only glitches that I have encountered so far, and for Early Access, that is pretty good.\n\nSo, the TL/DR version: it's on the right track but needs some entity-avoidance balance and a decent 'save' function. As an Early Access game, there are a few graphics and small glitches that need to be addressed, but nothing major. Otherwise, it's heading towards being a solid entry into the Backrooms genre!\n\n",

There are different locations to explore and one gameplay element I could find was collecting some pink shining stuff before the monster kills you. But even if you get killed, you are just spawning new with no effects. But the spawning is bugged, so often it won't load or the player is stuck and can't continue.\nI played with a friend 2 runs and both times we got stuck / bugged in the \"birthday\" level with the red carpet and balloons.\nWould not recommend in this state and after 6 months the possibility of improving the game is quite low so...",

      "review": "So there's a great deal wrong here. I encountered multiple bugs out of the gate, first of which was defining controls. The control visuals on the screen changed when I set the buttons, but when I went back into the interface to swap a button the visuals didn't reflect those changes. I ended up setting them 3 times thinking it wasn't doing anything. Flashlight, interact, and crouch don't have default buttons.\n\nSecond bug was the player names not displaying in the lobby. Mouse sensitivity isn't low enough, even for 800 dpi. I have my Nvidia \"Low Latency Mode\" set to ultra, which can often impact cameras, and in this case it made the game nearly unplayable on \"50\". Lower required.\n\nAI tracking is either find you anywhere, despawn after giving up, or simply lose track of you for almost no reason and wander away. They often spawn behind you and trap you places for almost no reason.\n\nClimbing into a locker broke my run. It also seems to happen randomly when crouching, but it can also repair run, so I don't really know what is happening there.\n\nThis needs a lot of work and some literal days devoted to QA with multiple people before I'll consider devoting time to it.",
