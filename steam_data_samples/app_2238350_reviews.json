This game requires joining the Discord for mods and doing a bit of file movement, but after that you have a pretty fun racing simulator, even if there's still a few kinks that should be worked out. The developer is currently on hiatus due to health issues, so I hope he gets better soon and we can continue to see this game improve and have a thriving community.",

      "review": "This game is so frustrating to me in a lot of ways. The game has such a good concept with it but just doesnt do a lot with it. The game is just an rng simulator of racing with messy stats and just weird things galore. That being said i do like this game a lot its a fun timesink that while very limited is still fun to see the wild shenanigans play out.\n\nIf i like the game why am i giving a negative review? For starters this game should've never been pay to play, i have no problem paying for things but putting a price point ruined the game from a modding aspect. I was around for some of the development of the first game and this one, the first game had a bunch of content but this one? Has like almost enough that i can could count on both of my hands. Which for a game thats been out for a year is bad. And just not a lot there, what it does is great but you cant switch manufactures (to my knowledge) or even sponsors. The points system is kinda glitchy, in which i saw a driver who was missed the playoffs almost win it, and the driver upgrading system is very mindlessly linear.\n\nAlso i dont recommend it based on the fact theres been zero updates to said game since early May nor any reason to believe theres gonna be content in the future. The game has at least a solid foundation, but with the lack of mods and updates im not sure whats there is really worth the $10. And I really hate typing this as i do like the game, I waited a long time to make this review but i felt it was necessary. This isnt to hate on the one guy or so who is working on the game, the game is way better than i could ever cobble together and i am glad it exists.\n\nIf you are debating on buying it, I'd go find some videos or something to see if this game if worth your mone before buying",

First of all, I think a link to the discord could help people find the mods they need since there really isn't a base game. \n\n\n\nI think the simulation and stuff is out of this world, anyone could win and i think its a pretty cool concept that many other racing games don't accomplish well. However still there is some things that needs to be worked on \n\nLater on the the sim, new teams appear but dont get added to the roster. My main sim only has 9 trucks because of this. 2nd of all, when drivers retire from the sport, they shouldn't be able to be eligible for a seat. Furthermore, I believe that another thing that needs to be fixed is that after a long time, it doesn't give u the cnace to look at the championships, like it does when ur like 1-20 years into the sim.        \n\n\nI do think however that it is an amazing game with some flaws the further u get into it",
