But there are stronger forces than just the criminal underworld at play: an ex-wife who hates him, a young son to take care of, and a dark secret held by pretty much everyone in town. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2238210/extras/how1.png?t=1691907990\" /><br>A decision-based RPG that lets you steer the story as you wish! Want to be a dutiful police officer? Or maybe you want to indulge your criminal side? Perhaps you want to ignore policework altogether and work on your side-hustle as a jazz saxophonist?

There are hundreds of choices to make, from the heartfelt, to the ridiculous, to the downright nasty, and each of them impacts how the story unfolds. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2238210/extras/retro.png?t=1691907990\" /><br>Sergeant Sqiudley is a love letter to the text-based DOS games of the late 80s and early 90s.

That\u2019s for you to decide. <br><br>As a freshly divorced man, Squidley can also pursue romantic relationships via the dating app Flintr, where you can set up dates with anyone you meet on your travels. <br><br>You\u2019ll also need to balance your core stats of Strength, Investigation and Handiness, while keeping Squidley rested and well-fed, lest his abilities and health begin to wane. Sergeant Squidley is a true detective sandbox, with hundreds of decisions to make and countless potential paths to follow. How will you spend your week in the shoes of Sergeant Squidley?",
