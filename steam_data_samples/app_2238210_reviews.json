I love the retro arcade style of the graphics and the creator\u2019s sense of humour really shines through as Squidley gets up to all sorts of crazy shenanigans while trying to figure out who is responsible for the murder of a colleague. \n\nThere are various options to choose from when guiding Squidley\u2019s actions so you can play the game several different ways and have fun side adventures as you work towards the overall goal of solving the case. I haven't managed to unmask the murderer yet so I'm looking forward to spending more time with Squidley and the colourful cast of supporting characters! Would highly recommend.",
