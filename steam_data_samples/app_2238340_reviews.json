      "review": "A very lightweight sports game, which is not at all a criticism, that rewards getting a feel for the physics of the ball and timing your jumps to propel the same over the head of one's opponent and into the goal. Making it feel, oddly, a bit more like volleyball than soccer.\n\nThe game plays better with a controller than the keyboard, and local multiplayer requires one player to use the controller, the other the keyboard. So this is well-suited, as 1v1 game, to playing with an opponent who is young or otherwise inexperienced at videogames, the better player using the keyboard controls.\n\nPlaying against the AI, one will find it occasionally a pushover, allowing an easy jump kick to score straight away in a match. And at other times, fairly good at defending and going on the offense.\n\nFor the price, that's not half bad.",
