No real game settings or options, and no option to exit the game until after you make it past the \"intro\" area. Subtitles take up half the screen. Examining items by clicking and dragging with the LMB is chaotic at best, but mostly feels broken for trying to actually discern anything useful from examining something. English localization is abysmal: While the game claims to have full English audio, count on the conversations being exclusively in subtitles with no spoken audio. The game recommends headphones for a superior experience, but the stereo effects make no directional sense.\n\nI have only regrets.",

The atmosphere is nice... they did a good job building the house... but they should've built a story on top of that too. Keep your money when it comes to this game.",

HOWEVER, i applaud the visual updates to the game and the effort to add more lore as well. i believe disabling headbobbing and motion blur should be an option in the settings as well as volume. i acknowledge the effort it takes to make a game, and this being the devs first, i hope The Cooking Class serves as a suitable teaching opportunity.\n\ni would also like to note how i appreciate how vocal the dev team is with the people whove interacted with this project. i hope it serves them well.",

No. And here's why.\nThere are videos, audios, texturing which are obviously hand made.\nAlthough not perfectly smooth it still is a nice game to play.\nThe morse code at the beginning, the phone number (try to send it a whatsapp message to see more horror and unlock a cool easter egg), everything adds to the lore and the horror.\n\nGraphics: 7/10 - I'd give an 8 for the effort of the post processing and psx style, but again, the graphics are the same of every other indie horror game\nStoryline: 10/10 - It has left me with the feeling that this is just the beginning of something much deeper\nGameplay: 7/10 - no cheap jumpscares, but the enemies are easily avoidable, a little improvement of the AI would be beneficial. Still though, very fun and scary.\nPrice: 10/10 - a bargain, I've bought it during sales but still worth the full price IMHO\n\nI'd like to support the devs, hope they open up a Patreon or Kickstarter to fund what's next. I hate to be left with this cliffhanger. I want to know more about the Duponts.\n\nCheers fellas!",

      "review": "It gets creepy very fast very quickly. Don't expect to be cooking a lot. Plus the feature to skip the cooking class altogether and go into action mode from the beginning is a blessing if you want to replay faster.\n\nPros\n\n- indie, fun game\n- creepy af\n- the backstory is really, really cool\n- it leaves you with the feelings that more has to be discovered\n- the atmosphere, man. Amazing\n- the music gets stuck in your head for days (maybe that's a con lol)\n\nCons\n\n- the animations are a little rough around the edges, there's room for improvement there, but for the price it is ok\n- the TV trigger that activates automatically when you walk in front of it, maybe a prompt command would've been better\n- it does give little to none hints, no markers, no help (this could also be a pro, if you like to hunt)\n\nAll and all it is a robust indie game. A little underrated if I may say so. You can tell this is a first release yes, but there's a lot of room for improvement for the devs.\n\nI'll be waiting for The Cooking Class - First Course (cool name btw) DLC\n\nSounds sweet",

See the feedback bellow, it was very close between a thumbs up/down but hopefully the developer will take some of these points into consideration and it would be definitely be a thumbs up. But for now, will be a no for me.\n\nGood\n\n- The atmosphere is great, the more you search the house the more sick and gruesome secrets you discover.\n- I loved the cheesy VHS tapes videos, gave me darkweb vibes. \n- Game is not overly complicated objectives, really good for streaming and casual play. Not sure if the game has multiple endings, but it is the kind of game I would play again to find different endings.\n- The plot in this game is very \u2018Cheesy Horror\u2019, and the developer did well to show that. As soon as she started talking about meat in the cooking class you knew exactly where the game was going, and if I was the character, I would have regretted my decision instantly of attending that class.\n\nBad\n\n- various bugs, hopefully these can be fixed.\n- you don\u2019t have to open the doors to collect the items, you can literally pick up the items just by clicking on all doors/drawers which makes it a click fishing game.\n- while at the cooking class makes the game doesn\u2019t tell you that you have to walk away from the class 3 times before the games actually starts. \n- AI for the granny upstairs could be a bit better.\n- music stays the same from the start menu  throughout the entire game.\n- a option to pause/skip the dialogue would be great as sometimes it can go too fast.\n- Biggest one for me is the bug at the end, where as soon as you go down the basement the antagonist appears and attacks you out of nowhere,  he gets stuck in an animation on your screen and you can\u2019t do anything bud die and start over again. \n\nRecommendations \n\n- Please fix the bug at the end, I tried reinstalling the game and I still getting the same bug, if at least that bug is fixed, the game would become playable and I would definitely give the game a thumbs up.\n- different music for the cooking part, not so spooky and then build up to a more ominous music once you start exploring the house.\n- skippable/pause option for the dialogues for sure.\n- some kind of indication that you have to leave the cooking class to start the actual game, I restarted the game 4 times before knowing I had to attempt to leave the cooking class 3 times to start exploring the house.\n- more Jumpscares\n\nI hope you find this feedback useful, this game has potential and perhaps could open up to other dark themed games from the same developer. I would love to get see a patch to fix these bugs and I would definitely have a another go at this game :).",

Here is my game play and play through \nyoutu.be/lzhEoxAZyTg\nI will talk about the following; Gameplay/Horror/Achievements/Worth The Buy? below.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nGame is a standard cut from horror games, you got a flashlight, hide and move around enemies to not get caught. Not a game where you fight back. \nYour goal is to find a way out of the trapped house you're in. Notes are left around with lore and tips on how to avoid the enemies. There are 7 VHS tapes to collect which will reveal how to escape.\n\nControls are perfectly fine, sometimes I found picking up stuff I had to look at it from a different angle or spam like the button, other times I would grab it from a great distance, but this isn't hindering at all. \n\nEnemies are relatively easy to dodge but can surprise you if you get over confident. Learned that the hard way lol.\nInteresting mechanics on the enemies to avoid them!\n\nGame took about a 20 minutes on a full run through, took me about a hour to do a couple tries to find the secret stuff.\n\n[h1] Horror [/h1]\nThis game uses cannibals as its main source of horror, but this game does even better is its ambience. Especially when youre doing the cooking class bit, Mrs Dupont mixed with the music really makes you feel like you're going to be stabbed in the back for grabbing some onions.\n\nThe actual jumpscares are kind of a let down. Them grabbing you for a second then just kinda carrying you is a little weird and lost its fear the second grab in.\n\nThe ambience makes you really feel like somethings coming to scare you pants off though. \n\nOutside of that the real horror is that if you do die, you have to start from the beginning again.\n\n[h1] Achievements [/h1]\n\nIts only got 7 achievements and they aren't hard. Get caught by the different enemies, fully complete the game and find a secret tape. I had trouble finding the secret tape, i searched every where I possibly could but couldn't find it. I will definitely be doing another run through of the game to find the tape as I don't want it to defeat me.\n\n[h1] Worth the buy? [/h1]\n\nIf you're a fan of horror and want a quick good experience 100%. It's $3bucks and you can tell the devs put thought and heart into it. You'll have a good horror experience and it won't take too much of your time.\n\nEasy achievement hunting? Also worth a pick up",

So if you get really far and near the end and die........it's to the start you go, hopefully something gets implemented to fix that!!!
