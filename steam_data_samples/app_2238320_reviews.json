Made do with a 3rd party remapping program.\nControl in the air is a bit weird, as though the character has more inertia than expected, and I found myself drifting into hazards easily.\n\nBut awkward controls with tight jumps and positioning would be fine were it not for the life system. You get [b]three lives plus one life per checkpoint. Use them[/b] all up (which you will) [b]and it's game over.[/b]\n\nContinues cost special gems that you only get at special checkpoints, and bring you to the very start of the entire level. So, good luck with that.\n\n[b]It's an awkward-to-control precision platformer that you will have to grind and grind and grind the same areas over and over and over until you've memorized every last inch.[/b]",
